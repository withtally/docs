# Delegations on Tally

### Tally is the best place to explore DAO delegates.

Need to delegate your own voting power? It's easier than ever:

{% content-ref url="delegating-voting-power/" %}
[delegating-voting-power](delegating-voting-power/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Not sure who to delegate to? Check out your DAO's Delegates Page to understand where delegates stand on important DAO issues:

{% content-ref url="../navigating-the-tally-platform/delegates-page.md" %}
[delegates-page.md](../navigating-the-tally-platform/delegates-page.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Tally is the best place to be a delegate.

You can use Tally to campaign for voting power and gain influence in your DAO. Ready to take a greater role in DAO governance? Start by building your Tally profile:

{% content-ref url="../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md" %}
[tally-profile.md](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Then, show where you stand with your delegate statement:

{% content-ref url="creating-a-delegate-statement.md" %}
[creating-a-delegate-statement.md](creating-a-delegate-statement.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
