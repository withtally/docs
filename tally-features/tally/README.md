# What is Tally?

## Why Tally?

Tally is the software layer for tokenized organizations. Winning teams use Tally to launch tokens, govern protocols, and grow with staking. Foundations, delegates, and token holders use Tally to manage $81+ billion in value for onchain protocols.

Launching a token is a public commitment that sets the foundation for an organizationâ€™s economic model, governance structure, and long-term credibility. Tally ensures teams launch tokens the right way with secure, modular contracts; a clear, phased rollout path; and purpose-built interfaces for claims, staking, and governance. Whether you're issuing a governance token or building utility into your protocol, Tally gives you the tools to do it cleanly, transparently, and at  scale.
