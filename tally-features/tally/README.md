# What is Tally?

## Why Tally?

Tally powers institutional grade tokens. Launch, manage, and grow the value of your token with Tally’s software stack ⬎

Launching a token is a public commitment that sets the foundation for an organization’s economic model, governance structure, and long-term credibility. Tally ensures teams launch tokens the right way with secure, modular contracts; a clear, phased rollout path; and purpose-built interfaces for claims, staking, and governance. Whether you're issuing a governance token or building utility into your protocol, Tally gives you the tools to do it cleanly, transparently, and at  scale.
