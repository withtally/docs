# The On-chain Thesis

### On-chain governance aligns with the core principles of decentralization and transparency.&#x20;

On-chain governance ensures that all decisions, proposals, and voting are recorded on the blockchain, making them publicly accessible and immutable. This prevents any single entity from having undue influence or control over the decision-making process and ensures that all members of the DAO have an equal say in its governance. Additionally, on-chain governance leverages the security and trustlessness of the blockchain, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud or manipulation. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and credibility of the DAO and for fostering trust among its members.

* **Transparency:** All decisions, proposals, and votes are publicly recorded on the blockchain.
* **Immutability:** Once recorded, the data cannot be altered or deleted.
* **Security:** The blockchain's decentralized nature and cryptographic security measures reduce the risk of fraud or manipulation.
* **Trustlessness:** There is no need to trust a central authority or intermediary, as the blockchain enforces the rules and executes decisions automatically.

### Moreover, on-chain governance promotes broader participation and inclusivity by allowing any token holder, regardless of their location or the size of their holdings, to participate in the decision-making process.&#x20;

This democratization of governance helps to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are considered and that decisions are made in the best interests of the entire community. Additionally, on-chain governance enables the automation of certain administrative tasks, such as the distribution of rewards or the execution of approved proposals, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing the risk of human error.

* **Inclusivity:** Any token holder can participate in the decision-making process, regardless of their location or the size of their holdings.
* **Automation:** Certain administrative tasks can be automated, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing the risk of human error.
