## Glossary

### Core Concepts

**Value Accrual**: The process by which a token captures and distributes value generated by an associated protocol or network, creating sustainable tokenomics.

**Staking**: The act of locking up tokens in a smart contract to participate in network validation, governance, or earning rewards.

**Tokenomics**: The economic model of a token, including its supply, distribution, utility, and incentive mechanisms.

**Rewards**: Tokens or other assets distributed to participants for contributing to the network, such as through staking.

**Yield**: The rate of return earned on staked tokens, typically expressed as an annual percentage.

### Staking System Components

**Staker Contract**: The main smart contract that manages token deposits, withdrawals, and rewards distribution.

**Earning Power**: A metric that determines a staker's proportional claim on rewards, which may be equal to or modified from their staked amount.

**Earning Power Calculator**: A component that determines how rewards are distributed to stakers based on various criteria.

**Reward Notifier**: A contract that informs the staking system about new rewards and triggers their distribution.

**Delegation Surrogate**: A contract that holds staked tokens and delegates their voting power to a specified address.

**Reward Stream**: The mechanism by which rewards are distributed gradually over time rather than all at once.

**Reward Duration**: The time period over which rewards are distributed (default 30 days in the Tally system).

### Governance Integration

**Delegation**: Assigning voting power to a specific address without transferring token ownership.

**Delegatee**: The address that receives voting power through delegation.

**Governance Token**: A token that grants voting rights in a protocol's governance system.

**Governance Staking**: Staking that preserves governance voting rights while earning rewards.

**Auto-Delegation**: A system that automatically delegates voting power according to configurable rules.

### Liquid Staking

**Liquid Staking Token (LST)**: A token representing a staked position that can be transferred or used in DeFi while the underlying tokens remain staked.

**stGOV**: Tally's liquid staking token implementation for governance tokens.

**Rebasing LST**: A liquid staking token whose balance automatically increases as rewards accrue.

**Fixed LST**: A liquid staking token with a fixed balance where the token-to-underlying exchange rate changes as rewards accrue.

**Withdraw Gate**: A contract that enforces a configurable delay when unstaking to prevent reward gaming.

### Reward Mechanisms

**Reward Source**: The origin of rewards distributed to stakers (e.g., protocol fees, treasury, or token emissions).

**Protocol Revenue**: Fees generated by a protocol's operations that can be distributed to stakers.

**Stake Streak**: A mechanism that increases rewards based on how long a user has been staking continuously.

**Bump**: The process of updating a deposit's earning power, which may be incentivized with a small reward.

**Reward Rate**: The speed at which rewards are distributed per unit of time.

### Advanced Concepts

**Oracle-Based Earning Power**: A system where external data feeds influence staking rewards, such as delegatee activity scores.

**Overwhelming Support Auto-Delegate**: A delegation strategy that only votes on proposals with significant consensus.

**Dual Staking**: The ability to use staked tokens for multiple purposes simultaneously, such as with EigenLayer.

**Restaking**: Using already-staked tokens to secure additional protocols or services.

### Technical Terms

**ERC20**: The standard interface for fungible tokens on Ethereum.

**ERC20Votes**: An extension to ERC20 that supports vote delegation.

**EIP-2612**: A standard allowing gasless approvals using signed messages.

**Permit**: A function that processes signed approvals without requiring separate transactions.

**OnBehalf**: Methods that allow actions to be performed on behalf of users via signatures.
