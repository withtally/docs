# Incentives & staking

Well-designed incentives and staking programs attract aligned token holders who add value to your protocol. Tally provides a complete, modular staking solution—open-source smart contracts and a ready-to-use interface that makes participation effortless. Deploy reward programs and staking systems tailored to your protocol's needs without building infrastructure from scratch.

Protocols use Tally's incentives and staking solution to return protocol revenue to token holders, reward long-term commitment, encourage governance participation, incentivize DeFi liquidity, and compensate network validators.

#### Key features of Tally's incentive and staking system:

* [Multiple reward sources](https://docs.tally.xyz/tally-features/staking/staking-customizations#returning-fees): Distribute rewards from protocol revenue, treasury assets, token emissions, or combine all three—in any ERC20 token or multiple tokens simultaneously
* [Governance integration](https://docs.tally.xyz/tally-features/staking/staking-customizations#governance-integration): Staked tokens retain full voting power, so holders don't have to choose between earning rewards and participating in governance. Optionally, make rewards conditional on active governance participation
* [Validator support](https://docs.tally.xyz/tally-features/staking/staking-customizations#network-protocol-validation): Compensate stakers and operators for validating protocol security and running network infrastructure
* [Stake streaks](https://docs.tally.xyz/tally-features/staking/staking-customizations#stake-streaks): Reward long-term commitment with increased rewards for continuous staking periods
* **Liquid staking support:** Enable token holders to earn rewards while keeping their tokens transferable and usable across DeFi
* **Flexible eligibility criteria:** Design custom requirements for earning rewards based on specific behaviors that benefit your protocol
* **Seamless user experience:** Your community can stake, track rewards, and manage positions through an intuitive interface
* **Battle-tested contracts:** Deploy with confidence using audited, open-source smart contracts
