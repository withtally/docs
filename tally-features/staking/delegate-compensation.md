# Delegate compensation

Reward active governance participants for their time, expertise, and contributions.

Compensation mechanisms encourage thoughtful participation while reducing voting power concentration among large holders. Tally's solutions include requirements to ensure only engaged and accountable delegates are rewarded.

### Reputation-based compensation

Design compensation structures that reward quality participation, not just voting power. Tally's infrastructure integrates reputation scoring to ensure rewards go to delegates who actively contribute to governance.

**Key features:**

* **Reputation score tracking**: Measure delegate engagement across voting, forum contributions, and discussion activity
* **Automated eligibility gating**: Only delegates meeting minimum thresholds receive compensation
* **Flexible distribution models**: Configure rewards based on voting power, reputation, or hybrid approaches
* **Transparent dashboards**: Public visibility into delegate scores and participation history

### Case study: Obol's delegate compensation

Obol uses Tally's infrastructure to reward governance participants based on [Delegate Reputation Score (DRS)](../governance/delegate-reputation-score-drs.md).

**How it works:**

Delegates receive scores from 0-100 based on voting participation, forum rationales, and discussion engagement.

Only delegates with DRS ≥ 65 qualify for compensation. Active delegates receive rewards using a square root model based on delegated voting power, reducing concentration while supporting smaller delegates.

Token holders view delegate scores and participation history directly on Tally for informed delegation decisions.
