# Features & Use Cases

### Returning Fees

Tally's staking system allows protocols to return protocol fees to token stakers. This creates direct economic alignment between protocol usage and token holder rewards.

**How it works:**

* Protocol governance decides what percentage of fees to distribute to stakers
* Fee distribution can be automated through smart contracts
* Rewards can be paid in native tokens, ETH, stablecoins, or other assets

Customer example: [Uniswap DAO plans to implement fee sharing with stakers](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936), allowing token holders to benefit directly from protocol growth and usage.

### Governance Integration

Unlike other staking systems that force users to choose between earning yield and participating in governance, Tally's solution supports both.

**How it works:**

* Staked tokens can delegate their voting power
* Optionally, rewards depend on the tokens being active in governance

Customer example: Obol implemented staking with governance integration, ensuring their stakers can earn rewards while still contributing to protocol governance decisions. Read the OBOL case study [here](https://tally.mirror.xyz/6e3I6e4K2FL_dcv5cnDTnJdQ0NSpqFnENZBAs7zre4s).

Other protocols like Rarible and Arbitrum are exploring making staking rewards conditional on delegating to an active delegate, further incentivizing governance participation.

### Network/Protocol Validation

Tally's staking system is compatible with staking and restaking protocols that provide validated services.

**How it works:**

* Native tokens can be used to secure actively validated services
* Compatible with protocols like EigenLayer and Symbiotic
* Aligns token holder incentives with network security

### Insurance Fund

Staked tokens can serve as insurance against reorgs or losses

**How it works:**

* Native tokens are staked in a pool and accrue rewards
* If something goes wrong, like a reorg or shortfall crash, staked tokens are slashed to cover the losses

### Stake Streaks

Stake streaks reward long-term holders, creating incentives for extended token holding periods and reducing market volatility.

How it works:

* Stakers' earning power increases over time
* Rewards scale based on continuous staking duration
* Encourages long-term protocol alignment, and reduces token velocity
