# Features & Use Cases

### Returning Fees

Tally's staking system allows protocols to return a portion of protocol fees to token stakers. This creates direct economic alignment between protocol usage and token holder rewards.

How it works:

* Protocol governance decides what percentage of fees to distribute to stakers
* Fee distribution can be automated through smart contracts
* Rewards can be paid in native tokens, stablecoins, or other assets

Customer example: Uniswap is planning to implement fee sharing with stakers, allowing token holders to benefit directly from protocol growth and usage.

### Governance Integration

Unlike traditional staking systems that force users to choose between earning yield and participating in governance, Tally's solution enables both simultaneously.

How it works:

* Staked tokens retain their ability to delegate voting power
* Tokens can be used in governance without unstaking
* Optional rewards can be tied to active governance participation

Customer example: Obol implemented staking with governance integration, ensuring their stakers can earn rewards while still contributing to protocol governance decisions.

Other protocols like Rarible and Arbitrum are exploring making staking rewards conditional on delegating to an active delegate, further incentivizing governance participation.

### Network/Protocol Validation

Tally's staking system is compatible with staking and restaking protocols that provide validated services.

How it works:

* Native tokens can be used to secure actively validated services
* Compatible with protocols like EigenLayer and Symbiotic
* Aligns token holder incentives with network security

### Stake Streaks

Stake streaks reward long-term holders, creating incentives for extended token holding periods and reducing market volatility.

How it works:

* Stakers' earning power increases over time
* Rewards scale based on continuous staking duration
* Encourages long-term protocol alignment and reduced token velocity
