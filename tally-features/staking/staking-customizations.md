# Features

### Returning fees

Tally's staking system allows protocols to return protocol fees to token stakers. This creates direct economic alignment between protocol usage and token holder rewards.

**How it works:**

* Protocol governance decides what percentage of fees to distribute to stakers
* Fee distribution can be automated through smart contracts
* Rewards can be paid in native tokens, ETH, stablecoins, or other assets

### Governance integration

Unlike other staking systems that force users to choose between earning yield and participating in governance, Tally's solution supports both.

**How it works:**

* Staked tokens can delegate their voting power
* Optionally, rewards depend on the tokens being active in governance

Customer example: Obol implemented staking with governance integration, ensuring their stakers can earn rewards while still contributing to protocol governance decisions. Read the OBOL case study [here](https://tally.mirror.xyz/6e3I6e4K2FL_dcv5cnDTnJdQ0NSpqFnENZBAs7zre4s).

### Delegate reputation scores

Tally's staking system integrates with [Delegate Reputation Score (DRS)](../governance/delegate-reputation-score-drs.md) tracking to measure and reward quality governance participation.

**How it works:**

* Delegates receive scores from 0-100 based on voting participation, forum rationales, and discussion engagement
* Scores update after each governance cycle to reflect current activity levels
* Only delegates meeting minimum reputation thresholds (e.g., DRS ≥ 65) qualify for staking rewards
* Token holders can view delegate scores and participation history to make informed delegation decisions

Customer example: [Obol](https://docs.obol.org/community-and-governance/governance/delegate-guide/delegate-reputation-score-and-compensation) uses DRS integration to gate delegate compensation, ensuring only active, engaged delegates receive staking rewards.&#x20;

### Liquid staking support

Enable token holders to earn rewards while keeping their tokens transferable and usable across DeFi.

### **Seamless user experience**

Your community can stake, track rewards, and manage positions through one intuitive interface.

### Network/protocol validation

Tally's staking system is compatible with staking and restaking protocols that provide validated services.

**How it works:**

* Native tokens can be used to secure actively validated services
* Compatible with protocols like EigenLayer and Symbiotic
* Aligns token holder incentives with network security

### Insurance funds

Staked tokens can serve as insurance against reorgs or losses.

**How it works:**

* Native tokens are staked in a pool and accrue rewards
* If something goes wrong, like a reorg or shortfall crash, staked tokens are slashed to cover the losses

### Stake streaks

Stake streaks reward long-term holders, creating incentives for extended token holding periods and reducing market volatility.

How it works:

* Stakers' earning power increases over time
* Rewards scale based on continuous staking duration
* Encourages long-term protocol alignment, and reduces token velocity
