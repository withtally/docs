# Features & use cases

### **Voting and proposal management**

Secure, transparent, and efficient voting mechanisms ensure all governance decisions reflect the will of the community. Collaborative proposal creation tools enable multiple contributors to work together seamlessly, while no-code fund transfers simplify complex governance actions without requiring coding skills. Approved proposals execute automatically with support for arbitrary executable actions that run directly through the governance system.

### Delegation&#x20;

&#x20;Enable token holders to delegate voting power to trusted representatives without transferring token ownership. Tally's delegation system supports full delegation, [partial delegation](../../how-to-use-tally/delegate-on-tally/partial-delegation.md) across multiple delegates, and integrations with [staking](../staking/) and t[oken launch](../launch/governance-smart-contracts.md).

### **Optimistic governance**

Streamline routine governance decisions with an efficient approval process that assumes most proposals are valid unless challenged. Proposals related to maintenance, technical changes, or parameter adjustments move through a structured process including proposal submission, due diligence review, council vote by delegates with technical expertise, and an optimistic veto window where the broader community can block proposals if needed. This approach prevents decision-making gridlock while maintaining community oversight and accountability.

### Security council elections&#x20;

Establish democratic elections for security councils that safeguard protocol interests. Through a transparent and structured election process, stakeholders select individuals with the expertise and commitment to navigate critical challenges while maintaining accountability. Tally's custom-built council elections ensure the highest standards of integrity in selecting leadership.&#x20;

### Delegate compensation

Reward active governance participants for their time, expertise, and contributions. Compensation mechanisms encourage thoughtful participation while reducing voting power concentration among large holders. Systems include requirements to ensure only engaged and accountable delegates are rewarded, such as maintaining minimum [reputation scores](delegate-reputation-score-drs.md) or meeting participation thresholds.

### **Multichain support**

Enable cross-chain governance with [Multigov](multigov.md) to meet token holders where they are. Organization members can govern from any chain, with support for Solana, Ethereum, and EVM-compatible L2s. MultiGov lowers barriers to participation by reducing gas costs for L1 governance and allows protocols to expand to new networks while maintaining unified governance.&#x20;

### **Gasless voting and delegation (Relay)**

Remove financial barriers to governance participation by eliminating gas fees for voting and delegation. Relay is a sponsorship system where organizations cover transaction costs for members' governance activities.&#x20;

### **Chain integration**

Expand governance across new EVM networks with full platform support. Tally integrates network archive nodes, block explorers, and API access to enable all platform features. Integration process typically takes 5-10 business days.
