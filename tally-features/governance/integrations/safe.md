# Safe

Gnosis Safe is a smart contract multi-sig wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur. This added layer of security helps to protect against the loss or theft of funds.

Creating a Gnosis Safe on Tally creates the exact same instance of Gnosis’s smart contract that Gnosis’s own app does, with the added benefit of managing it from the same Tally DAO that you may be using for Governor and Tokenless DAOs. Having your Gnosis Safe linked on Tally will also allow users to take advantage of Tally features such as the Create Proposal tool and Recipes.
