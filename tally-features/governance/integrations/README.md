# Integrations

Extend Tally's governance platform with integrations that enhance security, community engagement, and delegate transparency.

### **Safe**

Create or link a Safe to your organization for secure multi-signature treasury management. Managing your Safe through Tally enables access to all governance features maintaining the security of multi-sig approvals.

For help using Tally as a Safe multisig, [read more](../../../how-to-use-tally/use-tally-as-a-safe-multisig/).

### **Discourse**

Cross-post proposals to Discourse with Tally's forum bot. Automatically sync governance activity between Tally and your Discourse forum to keep community discussions aligned with on-chain voting. [Talk to our team to get started](http://tally.xyz/contact).

### **Karma - Delegate Scoring**

Distinguish high quality delegates from less active ones through our Karma integration. Delegates receive karma scores based on their participation in governance, both on-chain and in forums. [Talk to our team to get started](http://tally.xyz/contact).
