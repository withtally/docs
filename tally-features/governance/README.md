# Governance

Deploy production-ready governance  that scales with your protocol without requiring vendor migrations or custom integration work. As your governance matures, add advanced features like MultiGov, optimistic governance, or security council elections to meet the evolving needs of your community.

Protocols use Tally's governance solutions to enable decentralized decision-making, distribute funds, coordinate communities, streamline proposals, and ensure community oversight through transparent voting.&#x20;

#### **Key features of Tally's governance solutions:**

* [**Voting and proposal management**](features.md)**:** Secure, transparent voting mechanisms with collaborative proposal creation tools and no-code fund transfers. Approved proposals execute automatically with support for arbitrary executable actions.
* [**Delegation**](features.md)**:** Enable token holders to delegate voting power to trusted representatives without transferring token ownership. Supports full delegation, partial delegation across multiple delegates, and integrations with staking and token launch.
* [**Security council elections**](security-council-elections/arbitrum-dao-security-council-elections-guide.md)**:** Establish democratic elections for security councils that safeguard protocol interests. Tally's custom-built council elections ensure the highest standards of integrity in selecting leadership.
* [**Delegate compensation:**](features.md) Reward active governance participants for their time, expertise, and contributions. Systems ensure only engaged and accountable delegates are rewarded through minimum reputation scores or participation thresholds.
* [**Multichain support**](features.md)**:** Enable cross-chain governance with MultiGov to meet token holders where they are. Organization members can govern from any chain, with support for Solana, Ethereum, and EVM-compatible L2s.
* [**Gasless voting and delegation**](features.md)**:** Remove financial barriers to governance participation by eliminating gas fees for voting and delegation. Organizations cover transaction costs for members' governance activities.
