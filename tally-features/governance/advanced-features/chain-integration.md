# Chain Integration

#### To support protocols on a new network, Tally needs to integrate that network into its system. This integration enables all organizations on the new network to utilize our platform's features and services.  The integration process typically takes 5-10 business days to complete.&#x20;

## Implementation&#x20;

### Steps

1. Node integration: Tally integrates the network's (and testnet's) archive node RPC endpoints with our indexers.
2. Self-serve DAO addition: Tally adds support for the new network in our self-serve flow, allowing new DAOs on this network to be easily added to our platform.
3. Block explorer integration: Tally integrates the network's block explorer into our system for seamless transaction and address lookups.
4. API support: Tally provides API access to the network's data for all DAOs added to the platform.&#x20;

### Getting Started&#x20;

If you're interested in having your network integrated, please contact Tallyâ€™s sales team (sales@tally.xyz) with the required information. Once Tally has the necessary details, the integration process can begin as soon as the next business day.&#x20;

### Support&#x20;

For any questions or assistance during the integration process, please reach out to our dedicated support team via email at support@tally.xyz.
