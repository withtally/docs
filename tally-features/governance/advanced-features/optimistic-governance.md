# Optimistic Governance



## Introduction

Liquid democracy, where each token represents one vote, is an ideal governance model in theory. However, in practice, many DAOs face challenges such as voter apathy, lack of technical knowledge, and an overwhelming volume of complex proposals. These barriers can significantly reduce the effectiveness and speed of decision-making.

## The Case for Optimistic Governance

Optimistic governance offers a solution to these challenges by assuming that most proposals are approved, unless explicitly veto-ed by delegates otherwise. In this model, the decision-making process is streamlined, with a clear mechanism for delegates or community members to intervene if necessary. This is particularly useful for proposals related to maintenance upgrades, technical changes, or parameter adjustments, which may not require extensive community deliberation, but still need oversight and the ability to veto in the edge case that the proposed changes are malicious.

### Proposed Process for Optimistic Governance

To implement optimistic governance, Tally proposes a structured process designed to balance efficiency with accountability. The process involves several key steps:

1. #### Proposal Submission
2. Proposals are submitted by the proposer using a standardized template.\
   \

3. A proposal draft is shared with the community to gather initial feedback and ensure transparency.\
   \

4. A review process is conducted to ensure that the proposal meets the necessary criteria, such as technical feasibility and alignment with the DAO’s goals.\
   \

5. This stage may involve verifying the proposal’s technical details, ensuring that any code or assets involved are secure, and confirming that the proposal author is legitimate.\
   \

6. #### Council Vote
7. A council, consisting of delegates with technical expertise and community representatives, votes on the proposal.\
   \

8. If the proposal passes with a sufficient majority (eg: 4 out of 6 members), it proceeds to the next stage.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc9Kc6Fn2moKw1mao8WX5uaU0UM4lqyjo8Rbwf9TJ1fNqNAMcevCbXi6lXy3NyNSLNiTgTQJETH7QhLuvpNBZgZxvPx4JCjP09PPUmsYZAfUKVneFO2piR3iKhogj6LmSeeYd92?key=pvEa3YfTNKTAP4bRDQ7TCw)
