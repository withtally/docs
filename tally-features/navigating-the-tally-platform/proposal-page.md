# Proposal Page

> _The Proposal Page shows details of a particular active or past proposal. You can access the Proposal Page from the_ [_Proposals_](https://docs.tally.xyz/knowledge-base/navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page#proposals) _section of the relevant_ [dao-page.md](dao-page.md "mention"). &#x43;_&#x6C;ick the DAO name in the breadcrumb at the top left to return to the main DAO Page._

## Proposal Info

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2023-02-22 at 17.31.54@2x.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Proposal info.</p></figcaption></figure>

The top of the page shows the proposal title and its current status. It also shows the [tally-profile.md](tally-profile.md "mention") that created the proposal and when it was proposed.

## Voting on Tally

Voting is one of the most important actions you can take on the Tally website! When a proposal is active, you will see the **Vote onchain** button directly on the proposal page.

If the proposal is no longer active, you'll see its status there instead.

## Overview Chart

The _Overview_ chart below the [proposal info](proposal-page.md#proposal-info) shows participating addresses, with bubble sizes proportional to voting power. Below, you'll see the _Participation rate_ for the proposal.

## Voting Timeline Chart

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2023-02-22 at 18.11.10@2x.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Voting timeline chart.</p></figcaption></figure>

The _Voting timeline_ chart shows voter participation over the life of the proposal. Mouse over the timeline to see details about a specific voter.

## Votes Table

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2023-02-22 at 18.07.43@2x.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Votes table.</p></figcaption></figure>

In the right-hand panel, the _Votes_ table lists addresses that have participated in the vote, ranked by voting power.

The _Votes_ table only shows addresses voting **For** a proposal by default. Select the **Against** or **Abstain** tab to see those opposing the proposal or abstaining from voting, or the **View all** button at the bottom to open a page with all addresses in a single ranked list.

## Status Timeline

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2023-02-22 at 18.13.09@2x.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Status timeline.</p></figcaption></figure>

The _Status_ timeline shows details about the proposal's lifecycle, including timestamps. Click the three-dot menu icon to copy the block number at which the action took place.

### Description

The _Details_ section at the bottom of the Proposal Page shows the proposal's _Description_. If you used a Tally recipe to create the proposal, you'll also see an infographic with helpful information there:

### Executable code

Select the **Executable code** tab to review the proposal's onchain effects. One of the advantages of onchain DAOs is that anyone can see the exact smart contract calls that a proposal will make if it passes.

### Comments
