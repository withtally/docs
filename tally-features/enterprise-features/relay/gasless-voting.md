# Gasless Voting

Voting has [become unaffordable](https://x.com/LefterisJP/status/1766881140713935136?s=20) for many delegates on Ethereum L1. Tally provides the infrastructure for DAOs to fund a budget for gasless voting and execute voting transactions via a relayer service. The mechanism operates seamlessly as the allocated budget is submitted to Tally for the facilitation of these transactions.
