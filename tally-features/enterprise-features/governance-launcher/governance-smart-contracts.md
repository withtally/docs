# Governance Smart Contracts

With Governance Launch, Tally deploys the protocol’s governance smart contracts, including Governor and Timelock. These smart contracts enable fully decentralized onchain governance.

## Included in Tally’s Governance Launch Service

### **Token with ERC20 Votes Deployment**

Tally will deploy your token, a non-fungible, non-transferable token that can be minted and revoked by the Governor. ERC20Votes  extension ensures that your governance token supports vote delegation and efficient tracking of voting power over time.

### Governor and Timelock Contracts Deployment

Tally will deploy the Governor and Timelock contracts. The Governor contract facilitates the proposal and voting process, while the Timelock contract enforces a delay between the proposal's passage and its execution.&#x20;

* Flexible Voting Tally’s flexible voting setup prepares protocols for more advanced governance structures. Flexible voting enables sophisticated governance models like MultiGov and partial delegation.

### Governance Parameters Advisory

Tally provides detailed guidance on setting key parameters to ensure smooth and effective operation of the protocol’s governance system:

* Proposal Threshold, Quorum Requirement, Voting Period, Voting Delay, & Execution Delay, and more.
