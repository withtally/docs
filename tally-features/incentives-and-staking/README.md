# Incentives & staking

Well-designed incentives and staking programs attract aligned token holders who add value to your protocol. Tally provides a complete, modular staking solution—open-source smart contracts and a ready-to-use interface that makes participation effortless. Deploy reward programs and staking systems tailored to your protocol's needs without building infrastructure from scratch.

Protocols use Tally's incentives and staking solution to return protocol revenue to token holders, reward long-term commitment, encourage governance participation, incentivize DeFi liquidity, and compensate network validators.

#### Key features of Tally's incentive and staking solutions:

* [Staking for value accrual](staking-for-value-accrual.md): Return protocol revenue or treasury assets to token holders through staking rewards. Distribute value from protocol fees, native token emissions, or treasury holdings.&#x20;
* [Delegate compensation](delegate-compensation.md): Reward active governance participants based on their contributions and engagement. Integrate reputation scoring to gate compensation.
* Multiple reward sources: Distribute rewards from protocol revenue, treasury assets, token emissions, or combine all three—in any ERC20 token or multiple tokens simultaneously
* Governance integration: Staked tokens retain full voting power, so holders don't have to choose between earning rewards and participating in governance. Optionally, make rewards conditional on active governance participation
* Liquid staking suppor&#x74;**:** Enable token holders to earn rewards while keeping their tokens transferable and usable across DeFi.
* Flexible eligibility criteri&#x61;**:** Design custom requirements for earning rewards based on specific behaviors that benefit your protocol.
* [**Battle-tested contracts**](../../set-up-and-technical-documentation/staking-contracts/)**:** Deploy with confidence using audited, open-source smart contracts.
