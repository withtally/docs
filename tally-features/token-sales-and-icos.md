# Token sales & ICOs

Token sales are the future of fundraising. Some of the most successful projects in crypto launched with token sales, and new legislation in the [US](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3633/text) and [EU](https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica) is clearing the path for more projects to do the same. A token sale lets you raise capital and build community in a single event.

Done right, token sales have real advantages over alternatives. Venture funding concentrates ownership with institutions, low-float airdrops push price discovery to secondary markets, and IPOs can take years and require intermediaries.\
\
A well-structured token sale avoids all three.

Tally makes it easy for you to execute successful token sales. We handle the infrastructure — sale mechanics, compliance, branded interfaces, post-sale liquidity, and more — so you can focus on growth.

## How it works

### **What Tally does**

1. **Configure your sale:** Choose your mechanism (we support LBP, CCA, and fixed-price), set pricing parameters, and define eligibility rules. We’ll handle the app and smart contracts.
2. **Build your sale page:** Tally creates a branded, white-labeled experience on your domain. Your users never leave your site.
3. **Integrate compliance measures:** KYC/KYB/KYI verification, geo-blocking, region-specific lockups.
4. **Launch and monitor:** Go live with launch-day support. Real-time dashboards show participation, funds raised, and price discovery.
5. **Close and distribute:** The sale ends, tokens are distributed, and vesting schedules kick in automatically.

### **After your sale closes**

* **Proceeds go to your treasury.** The majority of funds raised transfer directly to your designated wallet or multisig.
* **Seed liquidity post-sale.** If you enable our DEX integration, a portion of funds and unsold tokens seed liquidity on Balancer or Uniswap. Your project controls this LP position.
* **Unlocks on schedule.** Newly-purchased tokens can unlock instantly or lock onchain, according to your requirements.

Keep building with Tally. After your sale, you can add [staking](incentives-and-staking/), [governance](governance/), and [incentive programs](incentives-and-staking/) through the same platform — no need to switch providers.

## Features

### Sale types

Tally supports multiple sale mechanisms. Each can be configured to match your distribution strategy and compliance requirements.

**Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs):**&#x20;

* LBPs enable price discovery through a declining price curve. The price starts high and decreases over time, discouraging early speculation and allowing broader participation at fair prices. Tally builds custom interfaces that abstract away the complexity of interacting with Balancer directly. Learn more about [LBPs](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/explore-available-balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool.html).

**Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCAs):**&#x20;

* CCAs enable market-driven price discovery through a fully on-chain auction. Bidders place orders that are split across auction blocks, with each block clearing at the identified market price. Transparent mechanics give buyers and investors confidence in the sale. Learn more about [CCAs](https://cca.uniswap.org/).

**Fixed-Price Sales:**&#x20;

* Set a predetermined price with optional allocation limits per wallet. Eligibility scoring and structured allocation reward long-term contributors, giving you control over who can participate and how much they can purchase.

### Platform capabilities

Configure parameters, liquidity, compliance, and post-sale operations through a single platform.

* **KYC/KYI/KYB:** Identity verification
* **Sale length:** Configurable duration and timeline phases
* **Starting price & price curve:** Set initial price and auction decay parameters
* **Bid currency:** USDC, USDT, or ETH
* **Geo-blocking:** Configure region-specific blocking to comply with your jurisdiction’s laws and regulations.
* **Lockups by geography:** Region-specific lockup rules and vesting schedules
* **Lockup parameters:** Add post-sale lockups with on-chain provider integrations
* **Post-sale liquidity:** Automatically seed DEX liquidity after the sale
* **DEX integrations:** Automatically seed liquidity on Balancer or Uniswap after the sale
* **Branded experience:** White-labeled sale page on your domain
* **Multichain support:** All major EVM networks supported: Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, ZKsync, Base, Monad and many more.
