# Token Launch

Tally provides the infrastructure and guidance to launch and operate tokens at any stage. Whether you’re shipping tokens with governance on day one or rolling out in phases, Tally's platform is built on years of helping the industry's largest protocols successfully launch tokens . We’ve supported launches like **Hyperlane,** [**Obol**](https://tally.mirror.xyz/6e3I6e4K2FL_dcv5cnDTnJdQ0NSpqFnENZBAs7zre4s), Arbitrum, ZKsync, and more.&#x20;

## Token Launch Features

### Modular Architecture&#x20;

Tally's system is designed with flexibility in mind. You can launch just the token, pair it with staking and governance from day one, or progressively enable those components later. This modularity ensures technical teams aren’t locked into premature decisions while still laying a foundation for future expansion.

### Full Lifecycle Support

From contract deployment to governance activation, Tally supports your team across every phase of launch:

* ERC20 token contract deployment (mint/burn, cap, upgradeable, etc.)
* Optional components: transfer restrictions, vesting, lockups
* Multichain support (bridged or canonical setups)
* Progressive rollout flows: e.g. claim site + staking before transferability
* Optional governance setup and delegation frameworks

### Production Ready Contracts

Tally's contracts are widely used and actively maintained. They're deployed across Ethereum mainnet and major L2s and used in production by protocols like Hyperlane, ZKsync, Wormhole, and more. Security and regular audits are first principles in Tally's deployment process.

### Custom Launch Infrastructure and Custom UI&#x20;

Tally offers branded, custom-built claim and staking frontends tailored to your protocol. UI and UX are developed in close collaboration with your team to ensure brand alignment and user clarity.

### Community Support and Integrations

Tally helps your team prepare for a clean launch:

* Pre-launch links and interfaces
* Educational and onboarding materials
* Page scaffolding

Additionally, Tally can integrate with tooling like [**Hedgey**](https://hedgey.finance/), [**Sablier**,](https://app.gitbook.com/u/8z9T9afYU7MkV2BBZhy8mul6Imn2) or other vesting and lockup providers depending on your needs. Some components may require coordination across teams.

## Launch Tokens with Governance

Tally offers protocols the ability to launch tokens with governance from day 1. Launching with governance includes everything in the traditional token launch package. Teams can also add governance at a future date.&#x20;

### Governance Smart Contract Development

_Tally will deploy your governance smart contracts, including Governor with Flexible Voting extension and Timelock. These will operate with your governance token seamlessly._

**Token with ERC20 Votes Deployment:** Tally will deploy your token, a non-fungible, non-transferable token that can be minted and revoked by the Governor. [ERC20Votes extension](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.5.0/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/draft-ERC721Votes.sol) ensures that your governance token supports vote delegation and efficient tracking of voting power over time.&#x20;

**Governor and Timelock Contracts Deployment:** Tally will deploy the [Governor and Timelock contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance). The Governor contract facilitates the proposal and voting process, while the Timelock contract enforces a delay between the proposal's passage and its execution.&#x20;

[**Flexible Voting:**](https://flexiblevoting.com/) Our flexible voting setup prepares you for more advanced governance structures. With flexible voting, you can implement sophisticated governance models, such as [MultiGov](https://tally.mirror.xyz/peHXv-1Bv4RY6Hf3UeCSH74aCu2e2ttSMytxJwB7DpY) and partial delegation, in the future. This adaptability is crucial for evolving governance needs, ensuring that your system can grow and adapt as the community scales.&#x20;

**Advising on Governance Parameters:** Establishing robust governance parameters is essential for effective decentralized governance. Tally will provide detailed guidance on setting the following key parameters to ensure smooth and effective operation of your governance system:

* Proposal Threshold
* Quorum Requirement
* Voting Period
* Voting Delay
* Execution Delay

### Delegate Registration ([Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryLl_-H9gNOZPCsz6Umdp330IIiVJFke/view?usp=drive_link))&#x20;

_Tally provides a comprehensive Delegate Registration flow, designed to streamline delegate acquisition._&#x20;

**Governance Launch Announcement:** Tally will launch a targeted campaign \~1 week prior to the launch, with a dedicated launch page (e.g.,https://www.tally.xyz/gov/DAOname) to build awareness.&#x20;

**Delegate Sign-up Process:** Tally will implement an intuitive sign-up flow for users interested in becoming delegates.&#x20;

**Newsletter Announcements:** Tally will feature the protocol's call for delegates in [The Tally Newsletter](https://newsletter.tally.xyz/), reaching an audience of over 1500 governance enthusiasts and potential delegates.

### Claim and Delegation Experience ([Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryLl_-H9gNOZPCsz6Umdp330IIiVJFke/view?usp=drive_link))&#x20;

_When delegation is not part of the initial claim process, the likelihood of subsequent delegation diminishes significantly. Inactive tokens sitting in wallets hinders active governance participation and that’s why we really recommend delegation go hand in hand with airdrop claim flow._&#x20;

_To ensure a smooth and convenient transition from token claim to active governance participation, Tally provides a post-claim delegation experience._&#x20;

**Custom Token Claim Interface:** Tally will create a custom UI for users to claim the governance token and immediately delegate their tokens to ensure governance participation from the onset.&#x20;

**Seamless Delegate Discovery and Selection:** Tally will develop a user-friendly interface that guides token holders through the process of discovering and selecting delegates, immediately following the token claim experience.&#x20;

**Delegate Profile Pre-population:** Tally will automatically populate delegate profiles with information gathered during the call for delegates phase, streamlining the selection process for token holders.

**Transparent Voting Power Display:** Tally will provide users with clear insights into their voting power alongside detailed information on incoming and outgoing delegations.

### Governance Launch Communications and Strategy&#x20;

_Tally has the largest media presence in the onchain governance space, with DAO Talk podcast, The Tally Newsletter, our Twitter, and the Tally blog. We are excited to leverage these platforms to spread the word about the protocol's launch, vision and strategy, and needs for delegation._&#x20;
