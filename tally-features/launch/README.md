# Token launch

Tally's token launch platform reduces time to launch with production-ready, end-to-end solutions. Set your protocol up for success with a launch platform that reduces engineering timelines, vendor migrations, and custom integration work. As your protocol evolves, add staking, vesting, governance, or multi-chain support to meet the needs of your ecosystem.
