# Token launch

Tally's token launch platform reduces time to launch with production-ready, end-to-end solutions. Set your protocol up for success with a launch platform that reduces engineering timelines, vendor migrations, and custom integration work. As your protocol evolves, add staking, vesting, governance, or multi-chain support to meet the needs of your ecosystem.

## Distribution systems

### ICO

Tally designs and deploys custom branded interfaces that simplify token sale participation, making it accessible to participants without requiring direct interaction with underlying protocols.

[Hyperwave](https://x.com/Hyperwavefi/status/1978810531848028617) partnered with Tally to plan and execute its token sale using Balancer's liquidity-bootstrapping pool (LBP). Tally built a custom token sale interface and worked with the Hyperwave team throughout the launch process to maximize token sales.

* **Custom sale interface:** Tally designed and deployed a custom branded UI that simplified the LBP participation process, making it accessible to participants without requiring direct interaction with Balancer's protocol.
* **Price discovery mechanism:** The sale used [Balancer's LBP,](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/explore-available-balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool.html)  which can be customized to any bonding curve the customer prefers. Price gradually decreases until demand is discovered, at which point price can find an equilibrium or increase.
* **End-to-end planning support:** Tally worked with Hyperwave to structure sale parameters, execution timing, and go-to-market.
* Hyperwave raised [\~$500k ](https://x.com/AbishekFi/status/1979883930389242350)in its intital token sale.

### Airdrop

Configure custom claim experiences tailored to your community and tokenomics. Set flexible eligibility criteria based on on-chain activity, snapshots, or allowlists. Deploy progressive unlock schedules, integrated delegation prompts, and branded claim pages that scale from hundreds to millions of recipients across any EVM chain.

* Hyperlane partnered with Tally to execute the HYPER token launch with native claim support across five blockchain networks. The launch distributed tokens to over 235,000 addresses who claimed nearly 70 million HYPER tokens using Tally's institutional-grade infrastructure.

### Eligibility criteria

Set flexible eligibility criteria based on on-chain activity, snapshots, or allowlists.

### Progressive unlock schedules

Deploy progressive unlock schedules that release tokens according to vesting parameters and compliance requirements.

### Modular architecture

Tally's system is designed with flexibility in mind. You can launch just the token, pair it with staking and governance from day one, or progressively enable components later.&#x20;

### Merkle distributor implementation

Tally's architecture handles concurrent eligibility checks at scale without performance degradation. The unified claim interface abstracts chain-specific complexity, allowing users to select destination networks through simple dropdown menus.

## Custom interfaces

### White-label UI development process

Tally offers branded, custom-built claim and staking frontends tailored to your protocol. UI and UX are developed in close collaboration with your team to ensure brand alignment and user clarity.

### Branded claim page

White-labeled claim and staking frontends developed in close collaboration with protocol teams to ensure brand alignment and user clarity. Custom domains maintain consistent branding across all token operations.

### Custom domains

Custom domains maintain consistent branding across all token operations.

## Vesting and Compliance

### Integration with providers

Optional transfer restrictions, vesting schedules, and lockup mechanisms with seamless integration to specialized on-chain vesting providers and custodians.

* Optional transfer restrictions
  * Implement transfer restrictions that enforce holding periods, compliance requirements, or vesting conditions. Restrictions can be time-based, milestone-based, or conditional on external factors.
* Vesting schedule configuration
  * Configure linear vesting, cliff vesting, or custom unlock schedules that match your tokenomics design. Tally's platform supports complex vesting logic including multi-phase unlocks and conditional release mechanisms.
* Lockup mechanisms
  * Implement lockup periods that prevent token transfers until specific dates or conditions are met. Lockups can apply to all tokens or specific allocation categories like team tokens, investor allocations, or treasury reserves.

## Multichain Support

### Bridged vs. canonical token setups

Launch with either bridged token setups (using cross-chain bridges) or canonical token deployments (native tokens on each chain). Tally supports both approaches based on your protocol's architecture and requirements.

### Simultaneous multichain deployment

Deploy tokens across multiple chains simultaneously with unified total supply management. Hyperlane's HYPER launched on Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Base, Optimism, and BNB Chain simultaneously, allowing users to access tokens directly on their preferred chain without wrapped assets while maintaining one unified total supply through Hyperlane's Warp Asset framework.

### Progressive rollout flows

Deploy claim sites and staking infrastructure before enabling token transferability. This progressive approach allows protocols to establish distribution and staking participation before opening secondary markets.

### Chain-specific configurations

Configure chain-specific parameters including gas optimization, block confirmation requirements, and network-specific features. Tally's architecture abstracts chain complexity while allowing customization for each deployment.

## Post-Launch Operations

### Adding features after launch

Tally's platform scales from deployment to ongoing operations without requiring vendor migrations or custom integration work. Add governance, implement staking, or expand to additional chains.

### Ongoing support and maintenance

Tally provides continued technical support, infrastructure monitoring, and feature development as your protocol grows.&#x20;

## Community Support and Integrations

Tally helps your team prepare for a clean launch:

* Pre-launch links and interfaces
* Educational and onboarding materials
* Page scaffolding
* Integration with specialized tooling and providers as needed

## Launch with governance

Tally offers protocols the ability to launch tokens with governance from day one. Launching with governance includes everything in the traditional token launch package. Teams can also add governance at a future date.
