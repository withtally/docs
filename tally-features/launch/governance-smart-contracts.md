# Launch with governance

Tally deploys your protocol's governance smart contracts, including Governor and Timelock, ensure a smooth and convenient transition from token claim to active governance participation.

## **Features**

### **Token with ERC20Votes deployment**

Tally deploys your token, a non-fungible, non-transferable token that can be minted and revoked by the Governor. The ERC20Votes extension ensures your governance token supports vote delegation and efficient tracking of voting power over time.

### **Governor and Timelock contracts deployment**

Tally deploys the Governor and Timelock contracts. The Governor contract facilitates the proposal and voting process, while the Timelock contract enforces a delay between the proposal's passage and its execution.

* **Flexible Voting:** Tally's flexible voting setup prepares protocols for advanced governance structures. Flexible voting enables sophisticated governance models like MultiGov and partial delegation.

### Claim and delegate

To ensure a smooth and convenient transition from token claim to active governance participation, Tally provides a post-claim delegation experience to enhance user engagement and simplify the delegation process.

### **Governance parameters advisory**

Tally provides detailed guidance on setting key parameters to ensure smooth and effective operation of the protocol's governance system:

* Proposal Threshold, Quorum Requirement, Voting Period, Voting Delay, Execution Delay, and more.
