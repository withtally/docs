# Launch with governance

Tally deploys your protocol's governance smart contracts, including Governor and Timelock, ensure a smooth and convenient transition from token claim to active governance participation.

## **Features**

### **Token with ERC20Votes deployment**

<details>

<summary>Launch with <strong>ERC20Votes</strong></summary>

Tally deploys your token, a non-fungible, non-transferable token that can be minted and revoked by the Governor. The ERC20Votes extension ensures your governance token supports vote delegation and efficient tracking of voting power over time.

</details>

### **Governor and Timelock contracts deployment**

<details>

<summary>Deploy  Governor and Timelock contracts</summary>

Tally deploys the [Governor and Timelock](../tally/governor-framework.md) contracts. The Governor contract facilitates the proposal and voting process, while the Timelock contract enforces a delay between the proposal's passage and its execution.

* [**Flexible Voting**](../../how-to-use-tally/voting-on-proposals/advanced-voting/flexible-voting-extension.md)**:** Tally's flexible voting setup prepares protocols for advanced governance structures. Flexible voting enables sophisticated governance models like MultiGov and partial delegation.
