# Vesting & disitribution

Optional transfer restrictions, vesting schedules, and lockup mechanisms with seamless integration to specialized on-chain vesting providers and custodians like [Hedgey](../../how-to-use-tally/proposals/creating-proposals/custom-actions/token-vesting-with-hedgey.md) and [Sablier](../../how-to-use-tally/proposals/creating-proposals/custom-actions/streaming-payments-with-sablier.md).&#x20;

### Use cases

**Team and investor allocations:** Distribute tokens to team members and investors with multi-year vesting schedules and cliff periods to align long-term incentives.

**Airdrop vesting:** Combine airdrops with vesting to prevent immediate sell pressure while rewarding community members over time.

**Grants and contributor rewards:** Set up vesting schedules for grant recipients and protocol contributors to encourage sustained participation.
