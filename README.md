# Welcome to Tally

### Token sales are a better way to raise capital

Token sales let you raise capital and build community in a single event — no multi-year IPO timelines, no gatekept VC rounds, no dilutive terms.

### But most token sales are flawed

The standard playbook has problems:

* **Compliance is an afterthought:** Many projects launch offshore, limiting access to U.S. participants and institutional capital.
* **No infrastructure for what comes next:** Teams scramble to set up liquidity, vesting, and governance after the sale.
* **Participants don't know what they're buying:** Opaque tokenomics, hidden insider allocations, and unclear unlock schedules erode trust.

### Token sales are hard to get right. Tally fixed it.
