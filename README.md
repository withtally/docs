# Welcome to Tally

Go public without gatekeepers. Token sales are the future of fundraising — faster, cheaper, and more globally accessible than IPOs and venture rounds. Tally gives you the infrastructure to launch your token, raise capital, and scale — one platform for the full token lifecycle.

## **Why token sales?**

The regulatory environment is catching up. Pending [U.S. market structure legislation](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3633) will create a clear compliance framework for U.S. companies to raise capital via token sales. 2025 saw a wave of successful token sales. [MegaETH](https://x.com/megaeth_labs) raised $50M through a 72-hour auction with over 100,000 KYC-verified participants. [Plasma](https://x.com/aspect_build) filled a $500M deposit vault in minutes. [Monad](https://x.com/moaboreth) raised $269M from 85,000+ participants in the first major U.S.-regulated token sale since 2018.

Token sales are a faster, more accessible way to raise capital. Compared to traditional fundraising, they offer real advantages:

* **Global participation.** Broad access for eligible participants worldwide, subject to jurisdiction and compliance requirements.
* **Better price discovery.** Prices are [set by the market during the sale](https://docs.doppler.lol/how-it-works/implementation), not by underwriters in a closed room.
* **Instant settlement.** Transactions clear on-chain in [minutes](https://www.fireblocks.com/glossary/transaction-settlement), not days.
* **Lower cost and faster execution.** Traditional IPOs require [12-18 months of preparation and millions in fees](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/deals/library/cost-of-an-ipo.html). Token sales can launch in weeks at a fraction of the cost.
