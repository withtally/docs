# PoolTogether (POOL)

## **Basic Info**

* Token: [POOL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pooltogether)
* Sector: Gaming
* [Tally Governance Page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/pooltogether)

## **Protocol Overview**

PoolTogether offers infrastructure for creating prize-linked savings (also known as zero-loss lotteries). Users can deposit various tokens into prize pools, with funds then invested into lending protocols or other yield sources to earn a return. The interest earned is periodically withdrawn and given to a randomized lottery winner, but users can always withdraw the amount they initially contributed (hence “no losses”).

Governance controls the PoolTogether treasury, which includes a large sum of POOL tokens as well as stablecoins and other assets earned from a 50% take rate on prize pool interest.
