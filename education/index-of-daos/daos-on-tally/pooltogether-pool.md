**Protocol Overview**

PoolTogether offers infrastructure for creating prize linked savings (also known as zero loss lotteries). Users can deposit various tokens into prize pools, with funds then invested into lending protocols or other yield sources to earn a return. The interest earned is periodically withdrawn and given to a randomized lottery winner, but users can always withdraw the amount they initially contributed (hence “no losses”).

Governance controls the PoolTogether treasury, which includes a large sum of POOL tokens as well as stablecoins and other assets earned from a 50% take rate on prize pool interest.
