**Protocol Overview**

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange protocol that enables trading between any Ethereum tokens. Liquidity providers can deposit asset pairs to earn trading fees, in exchange for bearing risk of losses from large price movements.

UNI token holders have control over a wide range of protocol assets and parameters through the governance process. This includes the community treasury (primarily composed of UNI tokens), setting fee rates for Uniswap v2 and v3, the ability to introduce new Uniswap v3 pool types, and control over the Uniswap v3 license.
