## **Protocol Overview**

Gitcoin is a protocol for funding public goods. It achieves this through a quadratic weighting mechanism that seeks to equalize input from all community members while minimizing sybil manipulation and fraud. Due to this protocol requirement, Gitcoin is a leader in decentralized identity research.

Governance controls a protocol treasury consisting of half of the total GTC supply. GTC holders are also responsible for overseeing and ratifying grants rounds and funding allocations proposed by the Gitcoin Grants Multisig.
