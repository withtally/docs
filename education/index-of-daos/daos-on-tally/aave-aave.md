## **Protocol Overview**

Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow a wide range of cryptocurrencies without the need for a traditional intermediary. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to automate the lending and borrowing process. Users can earn interest by providing liquidity to the platform and can borrow assets by providing collateral. Aave also features unique functionalities such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow assets without collateral for a very short period of time.
