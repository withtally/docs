* Sector: Asset Management

## **Protocol Overview**

Idle Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that optimizes the allocation of cryptocurrency assets to different lending protocols in order to maximize returns for users. It automatically rebalances users' funds between different lending markets, such as Aave and Compound, based on the best available interest rates and the user's selected risk profile. This allows users to earn the best possible yield on their assets without having to manually manage their investments across multiple platforms.

Idle governance controls a community treasury allocation, consisting of an ecosystem fund for general spending and a reserve for long-term liquidity incentives.
