# Balancer (BAL)

**Key Facts:**

* [Off chain voting](https://tally.document360.io/docs/en/on-chain-vs-off-chain-voting) using BAL token
* [Vote delegation](https://tally.document360.io/docs/en/vote-delegation) is not supported
* Uses [Snapshot voting](https://wiki.withtally.com/docs/snapshot-voting-design)

**Protocol Overview:**

Balancer is a decentralized exchange protocol that enables trading between standard Ethereum tokens. Liquidity providers can deposit groups of up to 8 assets in pools to earn trading fees, in exchange for bearing risk of losses from large price movements.

While the Balancer Exchange v1 is non-upgradable and has no governed admin controls, BAL holders are empowered to direct the treasury (including approval of grants and making changes to liquidity incentive programs) and may have a larger role to play in managing the forthcoming Balancer v2.

**Venues for Discussion:**

The majority of informal discussion takes place in [Balancer's Discord chat](https://wiki.tally.xyz/docs/balancer-bal-governance), with more formal proposals being aired in the [Discourse forum](https://wiki.tally.xyz/docs/balancer-bal-governance).

Balancer [will be integrating](https://snapshot.page/#/balancer/proposal/QmXQpKyw1BvYgZtvC2KGqrDezWBfSUBEKK77Kx866yBLYf) [Sourcecred](https://sourcecred.io/) into the forum and chat, allowing users to earn BAL for their contributions.

**Voting Interface and Process:**

Votes are generally held on a weekly basis, with discussion taking place in the forum during the previous week. Voting takes place via Snapshot, which was designed by a member of the Balancer team. Voting is gas free and low friction, but final results of proposals must be executed by the Balancer Labs team.

Balancer recently approved a [voting reward mechanism](https://snapshot.page/#/balancer/proposal/QmWtk4pJ2CNhmLFK9Nhk5gGD7xr2KbsK4cfpFXyR9YCbYG) called "gov factor", where addresses that participate in the most recent votes earn an additional 10% bonus on their liquidity rewards. Along with Balancer's recognition of BAL deposited within liquidity pools for voting, this added incentive helps align interest between the platform and liquidity providers.
