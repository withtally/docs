## **Protocol Overview**

Curve Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) optimized for stablecoin trading with low fees and low slippage. It operates as an automated market maker (AMM) and is designed to facilitate extremely efficient trading between assets that are pegged to the same value, such as different stablecoins (e.g., USDC, DAI) or different wrapped versions of Bitcoin (e.g., wBTC, renBTC). Curve allows users to trade between these assets with very low slippage, even with large trade sizes, and also allows users to provide liquidity to the pools and earn trading fees. Additionally, Curve has a governance token, CRV, which is used for governance decisions and can also be staked to earn additional rewards.
