* Sector: Exchange
* Governance: Offchain

## **Protocol Overview**

Sushi (formerly Sushiswap) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates as an automated market maker (AMM) and allows users to trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets. It is a fork of Uniswap, but with additional features and a community-oriented approach.&#x20;

Sushi also has a governance token, SUSHI, which is used for governance decisions and can also be staked to earn additional rewards. Sushiswap has implemented several innovative features, such as yield farming, where users can earn SUSHI tokens by providing liquidity to the platform, and Onsen, a program that incentivizes liquidity provision for selected token pairs. Additionally, Sushiswap has a feature called BentoBox, which is a vault that allows users to earn interest on their tokens while also using them as collateral for other DeFi applications.
