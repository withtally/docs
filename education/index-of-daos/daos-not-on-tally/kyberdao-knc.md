# KyberDAO (KNC)

**Key Facts:**

* [On chain voting](https://tally.document360.io/docs/en/on-chain-vs-off-chain-voting) using KNC token
* [Vote delegation](https://tally.document360.io/docs/en/vote-delegation) is supported (but delegate receives all voting rewards, not token owner)
* Uses unique KyberDAO governance framework

**Protocol Overview:**

Kyber is an exchange protocol that facilitates trading between a wide array of decentralized exchanges, market makers, and integrated applications. Kyber works similarly to an exchange aggregator, but with additional features that enable professional market makers to provide on chain liquidity according to bespoke strategies.

**Venues for Discussion:**

Discussion takes place in the community [discord chat](https://discord.com/channels/608934314960224276/681419703557685248), primarily in the governance channels. Formal Kyber Improvement Proposals (KIPs) are submitted and reviewed on [Github](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs). Kyber also hosts monthly community calls, which are announced in Discord. Formal governnace and proposal discussions are held in Kyber's [governance forum](https://gov.kyber.org/).

**Voting Interface and Process:**

KyberDAO governance is based on a cycle of 14 day voting periods called epochs. While KNC holders can deposit or withdraw their tokens from the governance contract at any time with no lockup, only those who keep their tokens locked from the beginning to the end of a given epoch are eligble to vote and receive voting rewards (in ETH).

Each epoch holds at least one vote for allocating protocol revenue between KNC burning, market maker fee rebates, and voting rewards (called a "BRR" vote). In addition, there are periodic votes for ratifying KIPs for other parameter changes or system upgrades. Rewards are issued in proportion to KNC voting power and participation, so users must vote in all polls in a given epoch to receive the full reward.

Over time, Kyber plans to transition more responsibilities from the core team to the DAO, including new token and reserve onboarding and powers of proposal submission.

In the short term, Kyber is considering migration to a new KNC token with a governance framework based on Aave's v2 governnace system. More details are available in [this forum post](https://gov.kyber.org/t/knc-token-migration-upgrade-discussion/64).
