# Sushiswap (SUSHI)

**Key Facts:**

* [Off chain voting](https://wiki.withtally.com/docs/on-chain-vs-off-chain-voting) using SUSHI token
* [Vote delegation](https://wiki.withtally.com/docs/vote-delegation) is not supported
* Uses [Snapshot voting framework](https://wiki.withtally.com/docs/snapshot-voting-design)
  * Proposals are executed via [multisig](https://wiki.withtally.com/docs/multisig-governance)

**Protocol Overview:**

Sushiswap is a decentralized exchange protocol. It was forked from the Uniswap v2 codebase, and features the same constant function market maker design. Liquidity providers earn SUSHI tokens by depositing funds to the exchange, and a portion of swap fees earned are redirected to SUSHI holders via staking mechanisms.

Sushiswap is also pursuing additional features, including a lending mechanism based off LP pairs and various other partner integrations.

**Venues for Discussion:**

Sushiswap has an active Discord chat group. Formal proposals and discussions are hosted in the Discourse governance forum.

**Voting Interface and Process:**

Sushiswap currently uses off chain Snapshot votes for decisionmaking purposes. Any approved proposals are then executed via a 9 member elected multisig.

The core contributors to Sushiswap are generally given broad leeway on day to day operations. This includes adjusting reward allocations and setting the direction for future development. Voters are typically only consulted for approving spending (eg. to onboard new contributors and devs) or for larger protocol changes which are codified as SIMPs (Sushi Improvement and Modification Proposals).

Sushi is fairly unique in it's vote weightling method. Only SUSHI/ETH Sushiswap liquidity pool token holders are granted voting power, so those holding SUSHI must provide liquidity if they wish to vote.
