# Governance Execution Methods

> _The execution of governance decisions is a critical aspect of any decentralized network as it ensures that the network can adapt, evolve, and operate efficiently without a central authority. There are several methods through which governance decisions can be executed in a decentralized network._

## Onchain Governance

Onchain governance involves the use of the blockchain itself to make and implement decisions. This method involves the use of smart contracts and the blockchain's native cryptocurrency to propose, vote on, and implement changes.

### Token-Based Voting

In token-based voting, the holders of the network's native token participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals. The weight of a participant's vote is often proportional to the amount of tokens they hold. Once a proposal receives the required number of votes, it can be implemented on the network.

### Delegated Voting

In delegated voting, token holders can delegate their voting power to a representative who votes on their behalf. This method is often used in networks that use Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) as their consensus mechanism.

## Offchain Governance

Offchain governance involves decision-making processes that occur outside of the blockchain. This method often involves discussions, debates, and voting that take place on online forums, social media, and other communication platforms.

### Core Developer Meetings

Core developer meetings involve the developers who maintain and update the network's codebase. These meetings often involve discussions on bug fixes, improvements, and new features. The decisions made in these meetings are then implemented in the network's code.

### User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF)

A User-Activated Soft Fork is a method where the users of a network, rather than the miners, enforce a change in the network's rules. This method is often used as a last resort when there is a disagreement between the network's users and miners.

## Hybrid Governance

Hybrid governance involves a combination of both onchain and offchain governance methods. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of both methods to create a more robust and flexible governance system.

### DAOs with Offchain Discussions

In this method, a DAO is used to propose and vote on changes using onchain governance. However, discussions and debates on the proposals occur offchain, often on online forums or communication platforms.
