# The Basics

Token sales are the future of fundraising. Some of the most successful projects in crypto launched with token sales, and new legislation in the [US](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3633/text) and [EU](https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica) is clearing the path for more projects to do the same.

A token sale lets you raise capital and build community in a single event. Done right, token sales have real advantages over alternatives:

- **Venture funding** concentrates ownership with institutions
- **Low-float airdrops** push price discovery to secondary markets
- **IPOs** can take years and require intermediaries

A well-structured token sale avoids all three.

## What is a Token Sale?

A token sale is a fundraising mechanism where a project sells tokens directly to participants. Unlike traditional fundraising, token sales can:

- Distribute ownership broadly from day one
- Enable price discovery through market mechanisms
- Build an engaged community of stakeholders
- Provide immediate liquidity for participants

## How Tally Makes It Easy

Tally handles the infrastructure so you can focus on growth:

1. **Configure your sale:** Choose your mechanism, set pricing parameters, and define eligibility rules
2. **Build your sale page:** Get a branded, white-labeled experience on your domain
3. **Integrate compliance:** KYC/KYB/KYI verification, geo-blocking, and region-specific lockups
4. **Launch and monitor:** Go live with real-time dashboards showing participation and price discovery
5. **Close and distribute:** Tokens are distributed and vesting schedules execute automatically
