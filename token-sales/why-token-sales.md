# Why Token Sales?

Token sales represent a paradigm shift in how projects raise capital and build communities. This page explains why token sales have become a preferred fundraising mechanism for crypto-native projects.

## The Problem with Traditional Fundraising

### Venture Capital Limitations

Traditional VC funding has served the startup ecosystem well, but it comes with significant trade-offs:

- **Concentrated ownership:** Early investors often acquire large stakes, leaving less room for community ownership
- **Misaligned incentives:** VCs optimize for their fund's returns, which may not align with long-term protocol health
- **Limited participation:** Only accredited investors can participate, excluding the very users who make protocols successful

### Airdrop Challenges

Airdrops became popular as an alternative, but they have their own issues:

- **Low-float launches:** Most tokens remain locked, pushing price discovery to thin secondary markets
- **Sybil attacks:** Free tokens attract farmers rather than genuine users
- **No capital formation:** Projects don't raise funds to support development

### IPO Drawbacks

Traditional IPOs remain inaccessible for most crypto projects:

- **Time-consuming:** The process can take years
- **Expensive:** Legal and banking fees are substantial
- **Intermediary-dependent:** Requires investment banks and regulatory approvals

## The Token Sale Advantage

Token sales solve these problems by combining fundraising with community building:

### Broad Distribution from Day One

- Tokens go directly to participants, not intermediaries
- Anyone meeting eligibility requirements can participate
- Creates a decentralized stakeholder base immediately

### True Price Discovery

- Market mechanisms determine fair value
- Auction formats like LBPs and CCAs prevent manipulation
- Participants set prices based on genuine demand

### Capital + Community

- Raise funds while building your user base
- Participants become invested stakeholders
- Aligned incentives between project and token holders

### Regulatory Clarity

<<TODO: Add section on recent regulatory developments in US (FIT21) and EU (MiCA) that are creating clearer frameworks for token sales>>

## When Token Sales Make Sense

Token sales are particularly effective when:

- Your project has a clear utility for the token
- You want broad community ownership
- You need capital for development and growth
- You're ready to operate transparently
