## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Rushing to Market

<<TODO: Add specific examples of projects that launched too early and the consequences>>

Taking shortcuts on preparation often leads to:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Regulatory issues
- Poor participant experience
- Reputational damage

### Unclear Token Utility

Tokens without clear utility face:
- Regulatory scrutiny as potential securities
- Lack of organic demand
- Price instability
- Community skepticism

### Inadequate Compliance

Skipping compliance steps can result in:
- Geographic restrictions limiting participation
- Post-sale legal challenges
- Exchange listing difficulties
- Ongoing regulatory burden

A typical token sale preparation timeline:

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Planning | 2-4 weeks | Define goals, choose sale type, engage Tally |
