# After Your Sale

Your token sale has closed. This guide covers what happens next and how to set your project up for long-term success.

## Immediate Post-Sale Actions

### Proceeds Distribution

The majority of funds raised transfer directly to your designated wallet or multisig:

- **Primary treasury:** Main funds go to your project treasury
- **Liquidity allocation:** If configured, a portion seeds DEX liquidity
- **Fee settlement:** Tally fees are settled automatically

### Token Distribution

Tokens are distributed according to your configured rules:

**Instant Distribution:**
- Tokens sent directly to participant wallets
- Available for trading immediately
- Suitable for fully liquid launches

**Locked Distribution:**
- Tokens subject to vesting schedules
- Unlock according to your parameters
- On-chain enforcement via vesting contracts

### Liquidity Seeding

If you enabled DEX integration:

- A portion of funds and unsold tokens seed liquidity on Balancer or Uniswap
- Your project controls the LP position
- Provides immediate trading venue for token holders

## Vesting and Lockups

### Managing Vesting Schedules

Tally integrates with on-chain vesting providers to enforce lockups:

- **Linear vesting:** Tokens unlock gradually over time
- **Cliff vesting:** Tokens unlock after an initial lockup period
- **Milestone vesting:** Tokens unlock based on defined triggers

### Geographic Lockups

Different regions may have different lockup requirements:

- Configure region-specific vesting schedules
- Ensure compliance with local regulations
- Manage multiple lockup tiers simultaneously

See [Vesting & Lockups](../compliance/vesting-lockups.md) for details.
