# Integrate compliance

{% hint style="info" %}
Token sales have rules about who can participate. Implement the right controls for your jurisdiction and risk tolerance.
{% endhint %}

### Identity verification

**KYC (Know Your Customer)** — Individual identity verification via ID documents and selfies.

**KYB (Know Your Business)** — Entity verification for institutional participants.

**KYI (Know Your Issuer)** — Links your token contract to verified team identities, addressing "unknown deployer risk."

{% hint style="success" %}
Tally integrates with a variety of KYC partners.
{% endhint %}

### Geographic restrictions

At minimum, block OFAC-sanctioned countries.

**Common configurations:**

| Approach        | U.S.                | OFAC    | Other         |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Conservative    | Blocked             | Blocked | Open with KYC |
| U.S. accredited | Accredited + lockup | Blocked | Open with KYC |

### Lockups by jurisdiction

Require tokens to lock for participants from certain regions.

**Example:** MegaETH offered U.S. accredited investors a compliance pathway with mandatory 1-year lockup.

### Legal documentation

Prepare with your legal counsel:

* Terms of Service
* Privacy Policy
* Token Disclosure (risk factors, tokenomics, use of proceeds)
* MiCA Whitepaper (if EU-compliant)
