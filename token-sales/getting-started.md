## The launch journey

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Are you ready?

Before launching, make sure you have legal counsel engaged, token economics defined, compliance decisions made, and a marketing plan ready. Don't know where to start? Don't worry, we have you covered.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Choose your mechanism](choose-your-mechanism.md)

How will price be discovered? How will you handle oversubscription? Different mechanisms offer different trade-offs between simplicity, fairness, and market-driven pricing.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Set sale parameters](set-sale-parameters.md)

Duration, tokens for sale, floor price, bid currency, allocation limits. These decisions shape your sale economics and participant experience.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Design your tokenomics](design-tokenomics.md)

Map your full allocation: public sale, investors, treasury, and ecosystem incentives. Finalize and document before announcing.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Configure post-sale](configure-post-sale.md)

Define where proceeds go, how liquidity is seeded, and how purchased tokens unlock over time.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Integrate compliance](integrate-compliance.md)

KYC/KYB verification, geographic restrictions, lockups by jurisdiction. Work with legal counsel to determine requirements, then implement through Tally.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Build your sale page](build-your-sale-page.md)

Branded, white-labeled experience on your domain. Custom design, real-time participation tracking, integrated registration and KYC flows.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### [Launch and monitor](launch-and-monitor.md)

Go live with launch-day support. Real-time dashboards, live participation metrics, and direct support from the Tally team throughout your sale.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
