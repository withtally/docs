At the top of the DAO page, a highlights section shows key information. You'll also see buttons to [**Create new proposal**](../proposals/creating-proposals.md) and [**Delegate vote**](../proposals/delegating-voting-power.md). Click the drop-down arrow to view _Contract Parameters._

## Metrics and Charts

The next section contains key metrics about your DAO:

* **Proposals:** number of proposals submitted
* **Holders:** total number of addresses holding the governance token
* **Voters:** total number of addresses with voting power delegated to them

The _Voting Power_ chart shows the current top 5 delegates' voting power over time, and _Top Voters_ ranks those delegates by voting power.

## Proposals
