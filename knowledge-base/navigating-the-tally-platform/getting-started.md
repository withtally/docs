# Getting Started

### Connect Your Wallet

> _Connecting your wallet allows you to delegate your voting power or vote on active proposals through Tally._

From any page on Tally, select the **Dashboard** button in the top right corner.

### Connect With A Safe

> _In order to use your Safe to vote on or create proposals, you must first connect your Safe wallet._

We recommend using WalletConnect from the Safe mobile app for the smoothest experience.

* [Desktop instructions](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/40849-walletconnect-safe-app)

{% hint style="info" %}
Looking to **update your Safe profile** on Tally? You'll first need to connect your personal wallet that is an _**owner**_ of the Safe (rather than the Safe wallet itself). Then follow the steps to [#sign-in-as-safe](getting-started.md#sign-in-as-safe "mention")!
{% endhint %}

## Sign In

> _Tally uses_ [_Sign-In with Ethereum_](https://login.xyz/)_. You'll need to_ [_connect your wallet_](getting-started.md#connect-your-wallet) _before signing in._

Once you've connected your wallet, you'll see a **Sign in** button at the top right corner of the Tally site.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 12.50.53 pm.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sign in.</p></figcaption></figure>

Follow the prompts in the pop-up window to sign in using your connected wallet.

The top right section of the page will now show a profile image and dropdown menu. Visit [tally-profile.md](tally-profile.md "mention") to learn more!

### Sign In As Safe

> _Tally allows users to perform onchain transactions while signed in as Safe. You can also update your multisig Safe's profile on Tally._

In order to sign in with your Safe, you must _first_ sign in with your personal wallet that is an _**owner**_ of the Safe. Then, from the profile drop-down menu, select **Sign in as Safe**:

Next, select the Safe you want to sign in as from the menu:

Now you can update your Safe's profile and make onchain transactions. To learn more about making onchain transactions using your Safe, see [voting-on-proposals.md](../proposals/voting-on-proposals.md "mention").

To switch back to your personal profile, simply select **Switch to...** from the profile drop-down menu.

## Disconnect Your Wallet

> _If you wish to disconnect your wallet from Tally, or switch to an alternate wallet address, you can do this through your selected wallet provider. The steps below show the process for disconnecting a MetaMask wallet._

Open the extension in your browser, then select **Connected** in the upper left.

![Select Connected.](https://p63.tr2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/L1uXmlOn/d42e3ffd-e332-4c75-ac01-16a0a7279ab0.jpg?v=adefb6e716a09273e4144c18e37e0145)

On the pop up, choose your currently connected wallet and select the option to **Disconnect this account**.&#x20;

You can confirm your wallet has been disconnected by checking the top right corner of Tally, which should now show the option to **Connect wallet**.
