## Your DAOs

> _The Your DAOs page shows all the DAOs you're a member of._

![Your DAOs page.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-25 at 1.06.50 pm.png>)

Your DAOs shows a list of all of the DAOs you're a member of, split into two sections: _DAOs you manage_ (DAOs where you have the Superadmin or Admin role), and _DAO memberships_.

{% hint style="info" %}
Click on any DAO to navigate to its [dao-page.md](dao-page.md "mention")!
{% endhint %}

## Profile

> _A Tally Profile shows details about that wallet's DAO Memberships and POAPs. It also includes information the user has added via_ [_Settings_](tally-profile.md#settings)_._

At the top, you'll see a voter's display name, wallet address, and linked Twitter account. You'll also see a **Delegate** button, which allows you to [delegate your voting power](../delegations-on-tally/delegating-voting-power/) to that address.

Below, you'll see that voter's _DAO Memberships_, with information on their voting power and delegations for each DAO.

Finally, the _POAPs_ section displays POAPs held by the address.

## Settings

> _Update the information shown on your Tally Profile by accessing **Settings** from the drop-down menu or clicking the **Edit Profile** button from your_ [_Tally Profile_](tally-profile.md#profile)_._

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2023-02-22 at 15.59.57@2x.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to make changes.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
The information you enter in Settings is public to everyone. The data in your [Tally Profile](tally-profile.md#profile) is a mix of onchain data and off-chain data. Editing your Tally Profile adds off-chain data to the onchain data for your address. In some cases, it overrides the onchain data (e.g. your Tally name and avatar override your addressâ€™s ENS name and avatar, if any).
