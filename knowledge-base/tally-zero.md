### What is Tally Zero?

[Tally Zero](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmZEunNyyBWbRRBSweQccSedEuzt3aFScVQGRqc73nkq1t/) is a completely decentralized voting application designed to facilitate onchain voting via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) through thirdweb. It serves as a fundamental tool to ensure that people can always vote onchain, even if all the more complex front ends, such as Tally and Boardroom, are down.&#x20;

### Features&#x20;

#### Decentralization&#x20;

Tally Zero is built using React and IPFS via ThirdWeb, which ensures that the application is completely decentralized. This means that it does not rely on any central authority or single point of failure, making it resilient and secure.

Onchain Voting The application allows users to connect to any governor address and vote on a proposal in a completely decentralized manner. This ensures that the voting process is transparent, secure, and tamper-proof.

#### Zero Dependency&#x20;

Tally Zero is designed to be a zero-dependency application. This means that it does not rely on any external services or applications to function. Even if other front ends are down, Tally Zero will still be operational, ensuring that people can always vote onchain.

#### IPFS Deployed&#x20;

The application is deployed on IPFS, a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. This ensures that the application is accessible from anywhere in the world and is resistant to censorship.
