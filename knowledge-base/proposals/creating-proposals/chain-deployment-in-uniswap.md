# Chain Deployment in Uniswap

You can make a proposal on Tally to [deploy Uniswap v3](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3) on a fresh EVM chain.

The first step of launching Uniswap V3 on a fresh EVM chain is to deploy the smart contracts that comprise the protocol. To simplify this process, Uniswap Labs has devised deployment scripts and management CLI, ensuring a smooth rollout of the required contracts onto a new EVM chain.&#x20;

Simply set up and fund a deployment account to cover the gas charges (estimating 40-50M gas). Then, execute a single command within the CLI. This will sequentially deploy each contract, marking checkpoints that can be rolled back if complications arise.
