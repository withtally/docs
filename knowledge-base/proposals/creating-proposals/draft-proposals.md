# Draft Proposals

### What are draft proposals?

Want some feedback on your proposal before it goes live? Keen to write it and have someone else submit it?

Draft proposals provide a more efficient and flexible way to get things done in DAOs. Draft proposals allow DAO contributors to save their proposals offchain in an easily digestible format for review before submitting them onchain.&#x20;

### Key Features

1. **Gather Feedback**: Users can easily gather feedback on DAO proposals _before_ submitting them onchain.
2. **Retain Context**: All draft proposal metadata is recorded and included in the onchain proposal when submitted.
3. **Flexibility in Submission**: Draft proposals are created offchain and can later be submitted onchain at any time. This makes it possible for different stakeholders to create the proposal and ultimately submit it.
