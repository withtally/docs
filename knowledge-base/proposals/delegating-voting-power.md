# Delegating Voting Power

_For DAOs that use the_ [_Governor contract_](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/deploying-governor-daos/deploy-a-governor)_, only delegated tokens can participate in voting. What does this mean for you, a token holder?_

_**You must set up delegation if you want to participate in governance votes. This includes delegating to others or voting yourself.**_

_If you wish to vote on proposals directly, delegate your voting power to your own address. Or, you can delegate your voting power to another community member and let them vote on your behalf._

### Delegate To Yourself <a href="#yourself" id="yourself"></a>

From the DAO Page, select the **Delegate vote** button.

_You can also delegate your voting power to a specific address directly on their_ [_Profile Page_](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md)_!_

### Confirm Your Delegation Status <a href="#status" id="status"></a>

Navigate to your [Profile Page](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md) by clicking your profile name at the top right and selecting **Profile** from the drop-down.

Select the DAO for the delegation you wish to confirm. You'll see whom you are delegating to directly next to your username.
