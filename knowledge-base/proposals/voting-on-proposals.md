# ✅ Voting on Proposals

_In order to vote on a proposal, first make sure that you've_ [_connected your wallet_ ](../navigating-the-tally-platform/getting-started.md)_and_ [_delegated voting power to yourself_](delegating-voting-power.md)_!_

_Note that tokens you own are not active for voting until you delegate. **You must delegate to yourself if you wish to vote on proposals directly with your own tokens.**_

### How to Vote <a href="#vote" id="vote"></a>

Navigate to the [DAO Page](../navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page.md) and scroll down to the _Proposals_ section.

Select the active proposal that you'd like to vote on to navigate to its [Proposal Page](../navigating-the-tally-platform/proposal-page.md).

In the _Voting_ pop up, choose your vote— **For**, **Against**, or **Abstain**. ( _Note that Abstain isn't an option in all DAOs, depending on their contract setup._) If you'd like, **add a comment** to explain the reason for your vote to the rest of your DAO. Once you're done, click **Submit**.

**Confirm** and sign the transaction via your connected wallet (example below shows MetaMask confirmation).

### Confirm Your Vote Status <a href="#confirm" id="confirm"></a>

Navigate to your [Profile Page](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md) by clicking your profile name at the top right and selecting  **Profile** from the drop-down.

The _Recent votes_ section displays your voting participation in proposals across all of your DAOs. You can also **select a DAO button** under _Your DAOs_ to filter votes by a specific DAO.

_Having trouble voting? There are a few common culprits to rule out..._

#### Are your votes delegated?

For DAOs that use the [Governor contract](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/what-is-a-governor-contract), only delegated tokens can participate in voting. If you want to vote on proposals directly, you need to delegate your voting power to your own address. Check out our [Delegate Your Voting Power](delegating-voting-power.md) doc for a step-by-step guide!

#### Is the vote for an offchain poll?

For offchain polls created in a Governor DAO, we use a snapshot to determine token weighted voting power. If you receive tokens _after_ the proposal was created, you won't be able to vote.

#### Have you waited for Tally to index the on-chain event?

Tally may still be indexing the vote—check back in a bit!
