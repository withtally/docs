# ðŸ’¡ Creating Proposals

_Get stuff done for your DAO by creating an onchain proposal on Tally!_

To submit an onchain proposal, you must have at least enough voting power to meet the DAO's **Proposal threshold**. You can find this number on each [DAO Page](../navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page.md) by expanding the _Contract Parameters_ section near the top of the page.

### Create a Proposal

Visit the [DAO Page](../navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page.md) of the DAO you'd like to create a proposal for, then click the **Create new proposal** button at the top of the page.

Select the **Onchain** button to create an onchain proposal.

If you haven't yet connected your wallet, Tally will prompt you to do so. Most governance frameworks require a proposal thresholdâ€”a minimum amount of voting powerâ€”to create a proposal. Make sure you connected with a wallet with enough voting power. Then click **Continue**.

Enter a _Title_ for your proposal, then add a _Description_. Explain the intent behind the proposal and include any helpful context for the voters. If you want, you can also add a _Preview image_. When you're ready, click **Continue**.

Add actions to be executed if the proposal passes. You can select Tally's **Transfer tokens** recipe for a proposal that calls for the transfer of tokens, or select the **Custom action** button.

_Note:_ _Governor Alpha/Bravo has a limit of 10 actions. There is no limit for OpenZeppelin Governor._

If you choose the Transfer tokens recipe, enter the _Target wallet address_, select the _Token_ you would like to transfer, and enter the _Value_ of the token you would like to transfer. Enter a _Memo_ to describe the purpose of the transfer, and optionally, upload a _Media image_ such as an invoice. Tally will populate an infographic as a preview of the recipe.

For a Custom action, enter the _Target contract address_ or upload your ABI file if the contract is not on Etherscan. Select the desired _Contract method_, and enter the call data for that method.

**Actionless Proposals**: If you choose to skip this step, and create a proposal with no actions, a transfer of **0 ETH** to you (the proposer) will be added, as Governor requires one executable action for the proposal to be submitted onchain.

Once you've added all actions, click the **Continue** button.

Almost done! Preview your proposal, then select **Save draft** or **Submit onchain**. If you're ready to submit the proposal onchain, you'll also need to sign the transaction to the chain using your wallet. Draft proposals are created off-chain and can later be submitted onchain at any time. Draft proposals can be created and submitted by different users.

## Running Proposal Simulations

_Having successful validations will give proposers, voters, and executors confidence that the proposal is valid. The Proposal Simulations feature is currently in beta and runs via the Tenderly Simulator API. Tally simulates the execution of the proposal assuming it is successful and queued on a fork of your DAO's network. From there, Tally runs each executable payload, impersonating the treasury (usually the timelock)._

When creating a proposal on Tally, the API will automatically run a simulation for the executable payload provided. You can view the result of this simulation in the Executable code tab of the proposal details. Each function will have its own result.&#x20;

If one function fails, it is likely that the proposal execution will fail. If the function failed, click **View raw result** to inspect the response from the Tenderly Simulator API for additional insights. If the function fails or in cases when state changes may impact the success of a function, you may also want to re-run the simulation of the proposal.

For example, a DAO proposes to transfer 1 ETH to an address, but their treasury has 0 ETH. As you might expect, the simulation result fails. From there, the DAO funds their treasury with 2 ETH; click **Re-run** to re-simulate the proposal. You should now expect a successful proposal!
