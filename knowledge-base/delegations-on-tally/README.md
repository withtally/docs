[delegating-voting-power.md](../proposals/delegating-voting-power.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Not sure who to delegate to? Check out your DAO's Delegates Page to understand where delegates stand on important DAO issues:

### Tally is the best place to be a delegate.

Use Tally to campaign for voting power and gain influence in your DAO. Ready to take a greater role in DAO governance? Start by building your Tally profile:

{% content-ref url="../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md" %}
[tally-profile.md](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Then, show where you stand with your delegate statement:
