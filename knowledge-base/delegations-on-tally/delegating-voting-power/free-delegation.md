# Free Delegation

### Token holders can delegate their voting power to themselves or someone else, and Tally will cover the gas fees for the delegation transactions.

However, there are some restrictions in place, such as meeting the minimum token requirements for each DAO. Token holders who are not eligible can still delegate normally by paying their own gas fees.

#### The restrictions for free delegation are as follows:

1. Tally will only relay for token holders who hold at least a minimum number of governance tokens. The minimums vary per DAO: 10 ENS, 10 UNI, 30 GTC, 40 ARB, or 50 POOL.
2. Tally will only relay a delegation transaction once per wallet per DAO.

### Currently, the following DAOs sponsor free delegation:

* Uniswap
* ENS
* Gitcoin
* PoolTogether
