# ⚡ What is Tally?

## Tally is a frontend for onchain decentralized organizations.

Tally gives users real power in their decentralized organizations. On Tally, users can delegate voting power, create or pass proposals to spend DAO funds, manage a protocol, and upgrade smart contracts—all onchain.

Onchain governance is important, no matter the chain. Tally supports DAOs on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Gnosis, Base, Moonbeam, and Scroll.

## Tally is for...

### Operators

Tally serves as a comprehensive platform for your DAO, handling the complexities so you can focus on running your organization. With Tally, you can:

* build a [home page](../navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page.md) for your DAO, so contributors have a one-stop shop to find information and participate in DAO governance.
* seamlessly [create](../proposals/creating-proposals/) and [manage](../proposals/managing-proposals.md) proposals, streamlining the decision-making process.

### Voters

Tally provides a unified platform for understanding and participating in proposal voting. With Tally, you have the ability to

* create and share your unique [profile](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md).
* [understand governance](../navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page.md) for your DAOs.
* [delegate](../proposals/delegating-voting-power.md) your voting power.
* [vote](../proposals/voting-on-proposals.md) on proposals.

### Delegates

Leverage Tally to amplify your influence within your DAO by:

* building a [profile](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md) that highlights your active participation in DAOs.
* broadcasting your [delegate statement](../delegations-on-tally/creating-a-delegate-statement.md) to garner support.
* [creating](../proposals/creating-proposals/) and [voting](../proposals/voting-on-proposals.md) on DAO proposals.

## About DAOs

DAO stands for _Decentralized Autonomous Organization_. **DAOs are decentralized communities of people who come together to develop projects on a blockchain.**

DAOs operate through decentralized governance, where members participate in transparent, democratic processes to make decisions, manage their funds, enhance their offerings, and foster growth.

For onchain DAOs, voting procedures occur directly on the blockchain and are executed via smart contracts. This ensures a _trustless_ environment, eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries to convey the results of decisions to the blockchain.
