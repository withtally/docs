# ⚡ What is Tally?

Tally gives users real power in their decentralized organizations. See what's happening. Then, create or pass proposals to spend DAO funds, manage a protocol or upgrade a smart contract. All on-chain.

## Tally is For...

### Operators

**\[**_**People building and launching DAOs.**_**]**

Tally provides a home page for your DAO. We take care of the hard stuff, so you can take care of running your DAO. Use Tally to:

* build a [home page](../navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page.md) for your DAO, so members have a central place to find information and participate in DAO governance.
* [create](../proposals/creating-proposals.md) and [manage](../proposals/managing-proposals.md) proposals.

### Voters

**\[**_**DAO members participating in votes.**_**]**

Tally offers a central place to understand and vote on proposals. On Tally you can:

* create and share a [profile](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md).
* [understand governance](../navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page.md) for your DAOs.
* [delegate](../proposals/delegating-voting-power.md) your voting power.
* [vote](../proposals/voting-on-proposals.md) on proposals.

### Delegates

**\[**_**DAO members who want to take a greater role in DAO governance.**_**]**

Use Tally to campaign for voting power and gain influence in your DAO by:

* building a [profile](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md) to showcase your DAO participation.
* sharing your [delegate statement](../navigating-the-tally-platform/delegates-page.md).
* [creating](../proposals/creating-proposals.md) and [voting](../proposals/voting-on-proposals.md) on DAO proposals.

## About DAOs

DAO stands for _Decentralized Autonomous Organization_. **DAOs are decentralized communities of people who come together to build things on a blockchain.**

On-chain votes happen on the blockchain and are executed by smart contracts trustlessly. That means that they do not need trusted intermediaries to relay the outcome of decisions to the blockchain.

DAOs operate via decentralized governance. Members engage in open, democratic processes to make decisions, manage their funds, maintain and improve their products, and invest in growth. For on-chain DAOs, decisions made via decentralized governance are executed _trustlessly_ using smart contracts.
