# âš¡ What is Tally?

### Tally is a front-end for onchain decentralized organizations.

Tally gives users real power in their decentralized organizations. See what's happening. Then, delegate voting power and create or pass proposals to spend DAO funds, manage a protocol or upgrade a smart contract. All onchain.

## Tally is for...

### Operators

Tally provides a home page for your DAO. We take care of the hard stuff, so you can take care of running your DAO. Use Tally to:

* build a [home page](../navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page.md) for your DAO, so members have a central place to find information and participate in DAO governance.
* [create](../proposals/creating-proposals.md) and [manage](../proposals/managing-proposals.md) proposals.

### Voters

Tally offers a central place to understand and vote on proposals. On Tally you can:

* create and share a [profile](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md).
* [understand governance](../navigating-the-tally-platform/dao-page.md) for your DAOs.
* [delegate](../proposals/delegating-voting-power.md) your voting power.
* [vote](../proposals/voting-on-proposals.md) on proposals.

### Delegates

Use Tally to campaign for voting power and gain influence in your DAO by:

* building a [profile](../navigating-the-tally-platform/tally-profile.md) to showcase your DAO participation.
* sharing your [delegate statement](../delegations-on-tally/creating-a-delegate-statement.md).
* [creating](../proposals/creating-proposals.md) and [voting](../proposals/voting-on-proposals.md) on DAO proposals.

## About DAOs

DAO stands for _Decentralized Autonomous Organization_. **DAOs are decentralized communities of people who come together to build things on a blockchain.**

DAOs operate via decentralized governance. Members engage in open, democratic processes to make decisions, manage their funds, maintain and improve their products, and invest in growth.&#x20;

For onchain DAOs, votes happen on the blockchain and are executed _trustlessly_ using smart contracts. That means that they do not need trusted intermediaries to relay the outcome of decisions to the blockchain.
