# Tally architecture



{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiCd7D5bhZk" %}

Tally is built on top of the [Governor standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance). Tally indexes the on-chain data from and enables users to make calls to Governor smart contracts running autonomously on the blockchain.

To be compatible with the Tally app, we recommend you use OpenZeppelin's [Governor contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance). This modular, battle-tested system of organization smart contracts gives token holders control of their organization on-chain.

A typical Governor organization uses three contracts: a token contract, a Governor contract, and a timelock contract.
