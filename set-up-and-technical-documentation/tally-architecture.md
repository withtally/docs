# Tally Architecture

Tally is built on top of the [Governor standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance). Tally indexes the onchain data from and enables users to make calls to Governor smart contracts running autonomously on the blockchain.

To be compatible with the Tally app, we recommend you use OpenZeppelin's [Governor contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance). This modular, battle-tested system of DAO smart contracts gives token holders control of their DAO onchain.

A typical Governor DAO uses three contracts: a token contract, a Governor contract, and a timelock contract.
