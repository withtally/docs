### Connecting your Arbitrum based Gnosis Safe to Tally.xyz

1. On [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz) select "Connect Wallet" from the [Arbitrum DAO page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum). Do not use the "WalletConnect" button. Instead click on "Using a safe on Arbitrum? Click here". This will open the standard WalletConnect flow.&#x20;
