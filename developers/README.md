- Interaction guides
- Integration patterns
- Security considerations

[View Smart Contract Documentation](smart-contracts.md)

## Integration Patterns

### Common Use Cases

**Frontend Integration:**
- Embed sale widgets
- Custom sale interfaces
- Real-time data display
- User authentication

**Backend Integration:**
- Webhook processing
- Data synchronization
- Automated workflows
- Reporting and analytics

**Smart Contract Integration:**
- Composability patterns
- Cross-protocol interactions
- Custom extensions
- Upgrade patterns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before integrating:

- [ ] Tally account and API access
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Test network access (for development)
- [ ] Understanding of EVM basics

### Quick Start

1. **Get API credentials:** Contact Tally for developer access
2. **Review documentation:** Understand available endpoints
3. **Start on testnet:** Build and test integrations safely
4. **Deploy to production:** Launch with confidence

## SDKs and Libraries

<<TODO: Add information about available SDKs, client libraries, and code examples>>

### Supported Languages

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Go
- Rust

### Example Code

<<TODO: Add links to example repositories and code samples>>

## Development Environment

### Testnets

Develop safely on test networks:

- Sepolia (Ethereum testnet)
- Arbitrum Sepolia
- Base Sepolia
- Other supported testnets

### Local Development

Set up local environments:

<<TODO: Add guidance on local development setup, including forking mainnet, running local nodes>>

## Security Considerations

### API Security

Protect your integration:

- Secure API key storage
- Use environment variables
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor for abuse

### Smart Contract Security

When integrating with contracts:

- Verify contract addresses
- Understand function behaviors
- Handle reverts gracefully
- Test thoroughly

### User Security

Protect your users:

- Never store private keys
- Validate user inputs
- Implement proper authentication
- Follow security best practices
