### What is Governance Launcher?

Governance Launcher is a comprehensive way to streamline and simplify the process of launching and managing a DAO. Governance Launcher includes 6 features.



With a focus on user experience and seamless integration, Governance Launcher offers tailored solutions that cater to the unique needs of DAOs, ensuring they can operate efficiently and effectively right from inception.&#x20;

1.  **End-to-end Governance Application**

    _Tally will provide a comprehensive governance solution, including all of the features mentioned in ‚ÄúAbout Tally‚Äù above. These features are complete and ready to be used by the DA):_

    * **Whitelabel Governance Platform:** Tally will build a whitelabel version of our governance platform that can be hosted at a custom domain like **vote.DAO.com** This allows the DAO to maintain its brand identity while leveraging Tally‚Äôs robust governance tools. [Here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/wormhole) is a live example of our platform customized for Wormhole DAO, which will be populated with proposals as the DAO launches.
    * **Voting:** Secure, transparent, and efficient voting mechanisms to ensure that all governance decisions reflect the will of the community.
    * **Proposal Execution:** Automated execution of approved proposals.
    * **Proposal Drafting and Collaboration:** Collaborative proposal creation through tools designed to enable multiple contributors to work together seamlessly.
    * **Proposal Creation with Arbitrary Executables:** Proposals can be created with customizable executable actions, allowing for a wide range of governance activities and decisions to be automated and enforced onchain.
    * **No-Code Transfers:** Easy and secure fund transfers within the DAO without requiring any coding skills.
    * **Notifications:** Real-time notifications about important events, proposals, and decisions within the DAO.
    * **DAO Analytics:** Detailed analytics and insights into DAO activities, member engagement, proposal outcomes, and overall performance.
    * **Gnosis Safe Management:** Gnosis Safe integration for secure and efficient management of DAO funds and assets.
    * **Wallet Support:** Native support for a wide range of wallets, ensuring accessibility and convenience for all DAO members.
    * **Public API:** Tally's comprehensive public API can power custom governance applications and integrate with other tools and platforms within the Ethereum ecosystem.
2.  **Governor Smart Contract Development**

    _Tally will deploy your governance smart contracts, including Governor (including Flexible Voting extension) and Timelock. These will operate with the $ZRC token seamlessly._

    * **Governor and Timelock Contracts Deployment:** Tally will deploy the [Governor and Timelock contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance). The Governor contract facilitates the proposal and voting process, while the Timelock contract enforces a delay between the proposal's passage and its execution. Governor contracts will include the following extensions:
      * [\*\*Flexible Voting](https://flexiblevoting.com/):\*\* Our flexible voting setup prepares you for more advanced governance structures. With flexible voting, you can implement sophisticated governance models, such as [MultiGov](https://tally.mirror.xyz/peHXv-1Bv4RY6Hf3UeCSH74aCu2e2ttSMytxJwB7DpY) and partial delegation, in the future. This adaptability is crucial for evolving governance needs, ensuring that your system can grow and adapt as the DAO scales.
    * **Advising on Governance Parameters:** Establishing robust governance parameters is essential for effective decentralized governance. Tally will provide detailed guidance on setting the following key parameters to ensure smooth and effective operation of your governance system:
      * Proposal Threshold, Quorum Requirement, Voting Period, Voting Delay, & Execution Delay
3.  **Delegate Recruitment**

    _Tally has established a network across the governance ecosystem, serving as a bridge between projects and professional delegates. Leveraging this network, we will recruit a tight-knit group of high-quality, value-aligned delegates for the DAO._

    * **Strategic Alignment with the DAO:** Tally will collaborate with the the DAO's team to identify key governance themes, challenges, and delegate characteristics that align with the DAO's long-term vision and governance structure. This ensures a bespoke recruitment strategy that targets delegates who are not only experienced but also deeply aligned with the DAO's mission and upcoming governance issues.
    * **Personalized Introductions:** Tally will provide direct connections to professional delegates, service providers, and other individuals within our network, tailored to match the DAO's governance wants and needs. We are also happy to have a Tally team member serve as a delegate.
    * **Co-marketing Efforts:** Tally will **s**upport in amplifying the DAO's calls for delegates through retweets.
4.  **Delegate Registration** ([Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryLl\_-H9gNOZPCsz6Umdp330IIiVJFke/view?usp=drive\_link))

    _Knowing well the importance of a structured and accessible delegate registration process, Tally provides a comprehensive Delegate Registration flow, designed to streamline delegate acquisition._

    * **Governance Launch Announcement:** Tally will launch a targeted campaign \~1 week prior to the launch, with a dedicated launch page (e.g.,https://www.tally.xyz/gov/DAOname) to build awareness.
    * **Delegate Sign-up Process:** Tally will implement an intuitive sign-up flow for users interested in becoming delegates.
    * **Newsletter Announcements:** Tally will feature the DAO's call for delegates in [The Tally Newsletter](https://newsletter.tally.xyz/), reaching an audience of over 1500 governance enthusiasts and potential delegates.
5.  **Delegation Experience**  ([Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l6JYr\_pRMIktr44Jf9\_RgfrhqO15AfbY/view?usp=sharing))

    _Tally makes it easy for users to delegate their tokens. Tally will create a customized delegation experience to ensure a smooth and convenient transition to DAO genesis with active governance participation. Inactive tokens sitting in wallets hinders active governance participation, as the Governor framework requires users to delegate to themselves or others to participate in governance._

    _We are eager to work together to drive delegation for the DAO‚Äîfrom a smart contract, UI, and go-to-market perspective. When delegation does not happen, we see situations with low ‚Äúvoters‚Äù (people who have delegated to themselves or others), making it impossible for the DAO to reach quorum required to pass proposals._ [_Blur DAO_](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/blur) _is an example of this._

    * **Seamless Delegate Discovery and Selection:** Tally will develop a user-friendly interface that guides token holders through the process of discovering and selecting delegates.
    * **Delegate Profile Pre-population:** Tally will automatically populate delegate profiles with information gathered during the Delegate Registration phase, streamlining the selection process for token holders.
    * **Transparent Voting Power Display:** Tally will provide users with clear insights into their voting power alongside detailed information on incoming and outgoing delegations.
6.  **Governance Launch Communication and Strategy**

    _Tally has the largest media presence in the DAO governance space, with DAO Talk podcast, The Tally Newsletter, our Twitter, and the Tally blog. We are excited to leverage these platforms share spread the word about the DAO's launch, vision and strategy, and needs for delegation._

    * [DAO Talk podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6nCG7KVFfn28NHgLmQH5tv?si=93882e2e1b4244b6): Tally will interview the DAO's core team members and highlight launch in an exclusive episode.
    * [The Tally Newsletter](https://newsletter.tally.xyz/): Tally will spotlight the DAO and its vision in ‚ÄúDeep Dive‚Äù.
    * [Tally Twitter](https://twitter.com/tallyxyz): Tally will co-market the DAO's launch through strategic tweets and retweets.
    * [Tally blog](https://tally.mirror.xyz/): Tally will co-create a blog article about the DAO's governance disseminated through Tally‚Äôs established blog and reshared through our communication networks.
