### What is Governance Launcher?

Governance Launcher is a comprehensive way to streamline and simplify the process of launching and managing a DAO. Governance Launcher includes 6 features:



With a focus on user experience and seamless integration, Governance Launcher offers tailored solutions that cater to the unique needs of DAOs, ensuring they can operate efficiently and effectively right from inception.&#x20;

1.  ## **End-to-end Governance Application**

    _Tally will provide a comprehensive governance solution, including all of the features mentioned in “About Tally” above. These features are complete and ready to be used by the DAO:_

    * **Custom Domain:** A version of our governance platform that can be hosted at a custom domain.
    * **Voting:** Secure, transparent, and efficient voting mechanisms to ensure that all governance decisions reflect the will of the community.
    * **Proposal Execution:** Automated execution of approved proposals.
    * **Proposal Drafting and Collaboration:** Collaborative proposal creation through tools designed to enable multiple contributors to work together seamlessly.
    * **Proposal Creation with Arbitrary Executables:** Proposals can be created with customizable executable actions, allowing for a wide range of governance activities and decisions to be automated and enforced onchain.
    * **No-Code Transfers:** Easy and secure fund transfers within the DAO without requiring any coding skills.
    * **Notifications:** Real-time notifications about important events, proposals, and decisions within the DAO.
    * **DAO Analytics:** Detailed analytics and insights into DAO activities, member engagement, proposal outcomes, and overall performance.
    * **Gnosis Safe Management:** Gnosis Safe integration for secure and efficient management of DAO funds and assets.
    * **Wallet Support:** Native support for a wide range of wallets, ensuring accessibility and convenience for all DAO members.
    * **Public API:** Tally's comprehensive public API can power custom governance applications and integrate with other tools and platforms within the Ethereum ecosystem.
2.  ## **Governance Smart Contract Development**

    _Tally will deploy your governance smart contracts, including Governor (including Flexible Voting extension) and Timelock. These will operate with your governance token seamlessly._

* **Token with ERC20 Votes Deployment:** Tally will deploy your token, a non-fungible, non-transferable token that can be minted and revoked by the Governor. [ERC20Votes extension](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.5.0/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/draft-ERC721Votes.sol) ensures that your governance token supports vote delegation and efficient tracking of voting power over time.
* **Governor and Timelock Contracts Deployment:** Tally will deploy the [Governor and Timelock contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance). The Governor contract facilitates the proposal and voting process, while the Timelock contract enforces a delay between the proposal's passage and its execution.&#x20;
  * [Flexible Voting](https://flexiblevoting.com/): Our flexible voting setup prepares you for more advanced governance structures. With flexible voting, you can implement sophisticated governance models, such as [MultiGov](https://tally.mirror.xyz/peHXv-1Bv4RY6Hf3UeCSH74aCu2e2ttSMytxJwB7DpY) and partial delegation, in the future. This adaptability is crucial for evolving governance needs, ensuring that your system can grow and adapt as the DAO scales.
* **Advising on Governance Parameters:** Establishing robust governance parameters is essential for effective decentralized governance. Tally will provide detailed guidance on setting the following key parameters to ensure smooth and effective operation of your governance system:
  * Proposal Threshold, Quorum Requirement, Voting Period, Voting Delay, & Execution Delay

3. ## **Delegate Recruitment**

_Tally has established a network across the governance ecosystem, serving as a bridge between projects and professional delegates. Leveraging this network, we will recruit a tight-knit group of high-quality, value-aligned delegates for the DAO._

* **Strategic Alignment with the DAO:** Tally will collaborate with the the DAO's team to identify key governance themes, challenges, and delegate characteristics that align with the DAO's long-term vision and governance structure. This ensures a bespoke recruitment strategy that targets delegates who are not only experienced but also deeply aligned with the DAO's mission and upcoming governance issues.
* **Personalized Introductions:** Tally will provide direct connections to professional delegates, service providers, and other individuals within our network, tailored to match the DAO's governance wants and needs. We are also happy to have a Tally team member serve as a delegate.
* **Co-marketing Efforts:** Tally will **s**upport in amplifying the DAO's calls for delegates through retweets.

4. ## **Delegate Registration** ([Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryLl_-H9gNOZPCsz6Umdp330IIiVJFke/view?usp=drive_link))

_Knowing well the importance of a structured and accessible delegate registration process, Tally provides a comprehensive Delegate Registration flow, designed to streamline delegate acquisition._

* **Governance Launch Announcement:** Tally will launch a targeted campaign \~1 week prior to the launch, with a dedicated launch page (e.g.,https://www.tally.xyz/gov/DAOname) to build awareness.
* **Delegate Sign-up Process:** Tally will implement an intuitive sign-up flow for users interested in becoming delegates.
* **Newsletter Announcements:** Tally will feature the DAO's call for delegates in [The Tally Newsletter](https://newsletter.tally.xyz/), reaching an audience of over 1500 governance enthusiasts and potential delegates.

5. ## **Claim and Delegation Experience**  ([Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ryLl_-H9gNOZPCsz6Umdp330IIiVJFke/view?usp=drive_link))

_We consistently see that when delegation is not part of the initial claim process, the likelihood of subsequent delegation diminishes significantly. Inactive tokens sitting in wallets hinders active governance participation and that’s why we really recommend delegation go hand in hand with airdrop claim flow._

\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;o ensure a smooth and convenient transition from token claim to active governance participation, Tally provides a post-claim delegation experience. This is crucial to enhancing user engagement by simplifying the delegation process._

* **Custom Token Claim Interface:** Tally will create a custom UI for users to claim the governance token and immediately delegate their tokens to ensure governance participation from the onset.
* **Seamless Delegate Discovery and Selection:** Tally will develop a user-friendly interface that guides token holders through the process of discovering and selecting delegates, immediately following the token claim experience.
* **Delegate Profile Pre-population:** Tally will automatically populate delegate profiles with information gathered during the call for delegates phase, streamlining the selection process for token holders.
* **Transparent Voting Power Display:** Tally will provide users with clear insights into their voting power alongside detailed information on incoming and outgoing delegations.
