Security Council Elections are...

### What is a Security Council?

In the rapidly evolving world of DAOs, the concept of a Security Council stands as a beacon of stability and security. The Security Council is a group comprised of a certain number of members who are vested with the authority to make urgent alterations to the protocol during emergencies. This council doesn't just govern; it acts as a protective shield against unforeseen threats, ensuring that the system remains secure, adaptable, and prepared for whatever comes next.

#### Roles and Responsibilities

The Security Council is comprised of 12 members who are entrusted with the responsibility of making urgent modifications to the protocol during emergencies. Their roles are outlined as follows:

* **Emergency Actions**: Addressing critical situations that demand immediate attention, such as potential risks to users' funds. To execute emergency actions, a consensus of at least 9 out of the 12 members is required.
* **Routine Operations**: Apart from emergencies, the council also supervises routine software updates, maintenance, and parameter adjustments, which are considered as "Non-Emergency Actions". A consensus of 7 out of the 12 members suffices for these actions.

#### Election Process

To ensure accountability and infusion of fresh perspectives, the members of the Security Council are elected democratically on a semi-annual basis. The election process is structured as follows:

* **Nomination**: Initially, contenders register to become nominees, requiring at least 0.2% of votes.
* **Compliance Period**: A 2-week period for the foundation to vet the nominees.
* **Election Period**: A 3-week period where delegates vote for the nominees, with the voting weight decreasing linearly over the last two weeks.
* **Results and Implementation**: Following the election, the top 6 nominees become the new members of the Security Council, with the results undergoing various time locks before the new members are integrated into the council.

#### Security Measures

The Security Council operates within a framework that emphasizes security by design, incorporating the following elements:

* **Constrained Access**: Access to the Upgrade Executor, a core component of the governance system, is strictly limited to prevent unauthorized or malicious activities.
* **Reuse of Existing Architecture**: Leveraging existing secure infrastructure to avoid the introduction of new contracts that would require additional security measures.
* **Adherence to Specifications**: The implementation strictly adheres to the guidelines outlined in the Arbitrum's Constitution, ensuring the intended security properties are met.

### Why should I care?

As a stakeholder in a DAO, the existence of a Security Council should matter to you for several reasons:

* **Security and Integrity**: The council acts as a safeguard, protecting the system and its users from potential threats and vulnerabilities.
* **Adaptability**: It ensures that the DAO remains versatile, capable of adapting to changing circumstances without compromising its foundational principles.
* **Democratic Governance**: The semi-annual elections foster a democratic environment, allowing for the inclusion of new skills and perspectives, and preventing the entrenchment of power.
* **Resilience**: In the face of emergencies, the council's swift actions help in maintaining the stability and functionality of the DAO, thereby preserving users' trust and investments.
