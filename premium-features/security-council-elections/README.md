# üîê Security Council Elections

> [‚ö†Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/warning) This page is a work-in-progress!

Security Council elections are a pivotal aspect of decentralized governance, ensuring that the guardianship of a DAO remains in the hands of its community. Elections serve as a testament to the democratic ethos of DAOs, allowing stakeholders to have a say in selecting the individuals who will be at the forefront of safeguarding their interests.&#x20;

Through a transparent and structured process, they aim to identify and empower those with the expertise, vision, and commitment to navigate the challenges that may arise, all while upholding the principles and objectives of the DAO. It's not just about choosing leaders; it's about reinforcing trust, fostering accountability, and ensuring that the DAO's security apparatus remains robust and responsive.

With Tally's custom-built Security Council elections, elevate your DAO's Security Council elections to unparalleled standards of excellence and integrity.

### What is a Security Council?

In the rapidly evolving world of DAOs, the concept of a Security Council stands as a beacon of stability and security. A Security Council is a group comprised of a certain number of members who are vested with the authority to make urgent alterations to the protocol during emergencies. This council doesn't just govern; it acts as a protective shield against unforeseen threats, ensuring that the DAO remains secure, adaptable, and prepared for whatever comes next.

#### Roles and Responsibilities

A Security Council is comprised of a certain number of members who are entrusted with the responsibility of making urgent modifications to the protocol during emergencies. Their roles are usually outlined as follows:

* **Emergency Actions**: Addressing critical situations that demand immediate attention, such as potential risks to users' funds. To execute emergency actions, a consensus of a certain number of members is required.
* **Routine Operations**: Apart from emergencies, the council also supervises routine software updates, maintenance, and parameter adjustments, which are considered as "Non-Emergency Actions".

#### Election Process

To ensure accountability and infusion of fresh perspectives, the members of the Security Council are elected democratically on a semi-annual basis. The election process is structured as follows:

* **Nomination**: Initially, contenders register to become nominees, requiring a certain percentage of votes.
* **Compliance Period**: A period for the foundation to vet the nominees.
* **Election Period**: A period where delegates vote for the nominees, with the voting weight decreasing linearly over the last two weeks.
* **Results and Implementation**: Following the election, the top nominees become the new members of the Security Council, with the results undergoing various time locks before the new members are integrated into the council.

#### Security Measures

A Security Council operates within a framework that emphasizes security by design, incorporating the following elements:

* **Constrained Access**: Access to the Upgrade Executor, a core component of the governance system, is strictly limited to prevent unauthorized or malicious activities.
* **Reuse of Existing Architecture**: Leveraging existing secure infrastructure to avoid the introduction of new contracts that would require additional security measures.
* **Adherence to Specifications**: The implementation strictly adheres to the guidelines outlined in the DAO's official documentation, ensuring the intended security properties are met.

### Why should I care?

As a stakeholder in a DAO, the establishment of a Security Council‚Äîand an efficiently run election‚Äîshould matter to you for several reasons:

* **Security and Integrity**: A council acts as a safeguard, protecting the system and its users from potential threats and vulnerabilities.
* **Adaptability**: It ensures that the DAO remains versatile and capable of adapting to changing circumstances without compromising its foundational principles.
* **Democratic Governance**: Elections at regular intervals foster a democratic environment, allowing for the inclusion of new skills and perspectives, and preventing the entrenchment of power.
* **Resilience**: In the face of emergencies, a council's swift actions help maintain the stability and functionality of the DAO, thereby preserving users' trust and investments.
