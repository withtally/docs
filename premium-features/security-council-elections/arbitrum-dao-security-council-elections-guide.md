# Arbitrum DAO Security Council Elections Guide

### What is the Arbitrum DAO Security Council Election?

The Arbitrum DAO Security Council is structured into two distinct groups, each comprising six dedicated members tasked with overseeing and mitigating risks within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

Elections are conducted every 6 months to appoint members to these groups. Each member serves a one-year term.

[The Arbitrum DAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) establishes a framework for electing members to the Security Council.

#### Round 1

* This round displays the list of candidates with associated vote counts.
* Voters can vote for their preferred candidates to qualify candidates for Round 2.
* The coundown timer indicates the amount of time remaining time in Round 1.

#### Compliance Check

The Arbitrum Foundation has 14 days to vet prospective nominees. If it finds that a candidate does not pass the compliance check, it may exclude the candidate from progressing to Round 2.

Note that grounds for exclusion can include greater than 3 members of an organization being represented in the nominee set (as described in Section 4 of the Constitution).

#### Round 2

* This round displays the list of qualified nominees who meet the compliance check in Round 1 with associated vote counts.
* Voters can vote for their preferred candidates.
* The coundown timer indicates the amount of time remaining time in Round 2.
* The 6 candidates who receive the most votes will be elected to the Security Council.

Voting power will decay if you do not cast your vote within the first 7 days:

* 0 - 7 days: Votes cast will carry a weight of 1 per token.
* 7 - 21 days: Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7-day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.

You can vote multiple times for different candidates.
