# Arbitrum DAO Security Council Elections Guide

### What is the Arbitrum DAO Security Council Election?

The Arbitrum DAO Security Council consists of 2 groups, each with 6 members who are responsible for managing risks in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Elections are conducted every 6 months to appoint members to these groups. Every elected Security Council member’s term lasts one year. [The Arbitrum DAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) establishes a framework for electing members to the Security Council.

### Navigating the Election
