### 1. Airdrop Claim Page

Our Airdrop Claim Page is designed to facilitate DAOs in distributing their tokens effortlessly. It's not just about claiming tokens; it's about integrating users into the DAO's ecosystem right from the start.

#### Features:

* **Delegate Profile Creation:** Users can set up their delegate profile on the DAO, ensuring they're recognized and can actively participate in the DAO's activities.
* **Eligibility Check:** Before claiming, users can verify if they're eligible to claim tokens, ensuring transparency and fairness in the distribution process.
* **DAO Information Access:** Users can get comprehensive information about the DAO, its objectives, rules, and more, ensuring they're well-informed from the get-go.

#### Goals & Objectives:

* **Smooth Launch:** Ensure a hassle-free launch of the DAO with minimal downtime.
* **Easy Token Claiming:** Enable eligible users to claim their tokens without any hiccups.
* **High Delegation Rate:** Drive a significant rate of delegation among eligible users.
* **Diverse Delegation:** Promote a varied distribution of delegation, ensuring a mix of both large and small delegates.

* **Custom URL:** Have your DAO page on a personalized URL, like dao.yourdomain.xyz.
* **Unique Interface Elements:** From headers to breadcrumbs, customize elements to align with your DAO's branding.
* **Tailored User Navigation:** Simplify navigation for your users by hiding non-relevant options like "Your DAOs" and "Search/Explore DAOs."
* **Integrated Profiles:** Clicking on "View full profile" from a delegate profile on your subdomain will redirect users to the full profile on the main platform.
* **Hardcoded URL Adjustments:** Ensure all embedded links and functionalities work seamlessly with your custom domain.

#### Goals & Objectives:

* **Branding Consistency:** Ensure your DAO's branding remains consistent across platforms.
* **User-Friendly Experience:** Offer a seamless experience for users, from navigation to accessing information.
