# Chain Integration

To support DAOs on a new network, we need to integrate that network into our system. This integration enables all DAOs on the new network to utilize our platform's features and services.

### Implementation Steps

The integration process typically takes 5-10 business days to complete. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

1. **Node Integration**: We integrate the network's (and testnet's) archive node RPC endpoints with our indexers.
2. **Self-Serve DAO Addition**: We add support for the new network in our self-serve flow, allowing new DAOs on this network to be easily added to our platform.
3. **Block Explorer Integration**: We integrate the network's block explorer into our system for seamless transaction and address lookups.
4. **API Support**: We provide API access to the network's data for all DAOs added to the platform.

### Requirements

To proceed with the integration, we need the following information from the network:

1. Link to an archive node (for both Testnet & Mainnet)
2. Link to the network's block explorer

### Getting Started

If you're interested in having your network integrated, please contact our sales team (sales@tally.xyz) with the required information. Once we have the necessary details, we can begin the integration process as soon as the next business week.

### Support

For any questions or assistance during the integration process, please don't hesitate to reach out to our dedicated support team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/tallyxyz) or email (support@tally.xyz).
