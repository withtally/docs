## Tally Profile

### Your organizations

The Your organizations page shows all the organizations you're a member of.

Your organizations shows a list of all of the organizations you're a member of, split into two sections: organizations you manage (organizations where you have the SuperAdmin or Admin role), and organization memberships. Click on any organization to navigate to its organization Page.

### Profile&#x20;

A Tally Profile shows details about that wallet's organization Memberships and POAPs. It also includes information the user has added via Settings.

At the top, you'll see a voter's display name, wallet address, and linked Twitter account. You'll also see a Delegate button, which allows you to delegate your voting power to that address.

Below, you'll see that voter's organization Memberships, with information on their voting power and delegations for each organization.

The POAPs section displays POAPs held by the address.

Click the **Edit** button to make changes.

The information you enter in Settings is public to everyone. The data in your Tally Profile is a mix of on-chain data and off-chain data. Editing your Tally Profile adds off-chain data to the on-chain data for your address. In some cases, it overrides the on-chain data (e.g. your Tally name and avatar override your address’s ENS name and avatar, if any).
