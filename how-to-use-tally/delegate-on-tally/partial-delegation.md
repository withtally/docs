# Partial Delegation

Partial delegation is a voting mechanism that allows token holders to split voting power across multiple delegates rather than assigning it all to a single delegate. For example, if a user controls 1000 tokens, the user could delegate 400 tokens to Delegate A, 400 tokens to Delegate B, and self-delegate the remaining tokens.&#x20;
