# Using Ledger with Solana

## Setup Process

### 1. Create Profile with Software Wallet

* Download and install [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), [Backpack](https://www.backpack.app/), or [Solflare](https://www.solflare.com/)
* Connect this wallet to our platform
* Complete the profile creation process

**Important:** If you have Rabby wallet installed as a browser extension, it may prevent Solana wallets from being detected. If you don't see your Solana wallet options, temporarily disable the Rabby extension and refresh the page.

### 2. Request Profile Address Update

* Obtain your Ledger's Solana address through your wallet interface
* Email [support@tally.xyz](mailto:support@tally.xyz) with:
  * Subject: "Ledger Address Update"
  * Current profile address (from software wallet)
  * Ledger Solana address

### 3. Use Your Ledger

* You'll receive email confirmation when your profile is updated
* Connect your Ledger device when accessing our platform
* You'll need to add your hardware wallet through your software wallet's interface
* Create a new stake account specifically for your Ledger wallet address (similar to the stake account you made with your software wallet)
* Use your hardware wallet for all transactions moving forward
