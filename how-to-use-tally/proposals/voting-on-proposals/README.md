# Vote on Tally

_In order to vote on a proposal, first make sure that you've_ [_connected your wallet_ ](../../../tally-features/navigating-the-tally-platform/getting-started.md)_and_ [_delegated voting power to yourself_](../../../tally-features/delegations-on-tally/delegating-voting-power/)_!_

_Note that tokens you own are not active for voting until you delegate. **You must delegate to yourself if you wish to vote on proposals directly with your own tokens.**_

### How to Vote <a href="#vote" id="vote"></a>

Select the active proposal that you'd like to vote on to navigate to its [Proposal Page](../../../tally-features/navigating-the-tally-platform/proposal-page.md).

Click on the **Vote** button in the upper right corner of the page.

In the _Voting_ pop up, choose your vote— **For**, **Against**, or **Abstain**. (_Note that Abstain isn't an option in all DAOs, depending on their contract setup._) If you'd like, **add a comment** to explain the reason for your vote to the rest of your DAO. Once you're done, click **Submit**.

**Confirm** and sign the transaction via your connected wallet (example below shows MetaMask confirmation).

### Having trouble voting? There are a few common culprits to rule out...

#### Are your votes delegated?

For DAOs that use the [Governor contract](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/deploying-governor-daos/deploy-a-governor), only delegated tokens can participate in voting. If you want to vote on proposals directly, you need to delegate your voting power to your own address. Check out our [Delegate Your Voting Power](../../../tally-features/delegations-on-tally/delegating-voting-power/) doc for a step-by-step guide!

#### Have you waited for Tally to index the onchain event?

Tally may still be indexing the vote—check back in a bit!
