### wstOBOL Support

Tally now provides comprehensive support for wstOBOL (wrapped stOBOL), enabling OBOL governance participants to seamlessly manage their tokens across DeFi protocols while maintaining visibility of their total governance power.

As OBOL expands into Pendle, token holders need tools to:

* Track balances across all OBOL token variants (OBOL, stOBOL, wstOBOL)
* Easily convert between token types in one canonical place
* Understand their total voting power regardless of token distribution
* Make informed decisions about governance vs. DeFi participation

Access NatSpec documentation of all the functions in the contract source code & more on [GitHub](https://github.com/withtally/stGOV/blob/main/src/WrappedGovLst.sol).

For detailed information about wstOBOL and how it works, see Obol's [wstOBOL documentation](https://docs.obol.org/community-and-governance/obol-token/wstobol#what-is-wstobol).&#x20;
