# Use Tally with a Gnosis Safe

_Before making onchain transactions as Safe, you must be signed in as Safe._&#x20;

All onchain transactions as Safe are supported and sent via the Safe transaction service instead of the connected EOA. Currently, the following transactions are supported:&#x20;

* Submit proposal from the create proposal flow&#x20;
* Submit proposal from draft page&#x20;
* Vote on proposal&#x20;
* Queue proposal&#x20;
* Execute proposal&#x20;
* Delegate voting power&#x20;

We are also working on support for the following transactions as Safe:&#x20;

* Vote in Council election&#x20;
* Register for Council election&#x20;
* Claim airdrop
