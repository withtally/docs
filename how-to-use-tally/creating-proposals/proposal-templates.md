# Proposal templates

Users can easily draft proposals using proposal templates that are set up by their DAO. Instead of manually locating, copying, and pasting a contract address for a custom action, users can conveniently create a proposal using their DAOâ€™s custom contract address book. Additionally, proposals created using proposal templates are also more easily identifiable on the proposal page since they have human readable names.
