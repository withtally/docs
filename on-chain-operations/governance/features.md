# Features

### **Voting and proposal management**

Secure, transparent, and efficient voting mechanisms ensure all governance decisions reflect the will of the community. Collaborative proposal creation tools enable multiple contributors to work together seamlessly, while no-code fund transfers simplify complex governance actions without requiring coding skills. Approved proposals execute automatically with support for arbitrary executable actions that run directly through the governance system.

Learn more about [voting](../../how-to-use-tally/voting-on-proposals/) and delegating on [Tally](../../how-to-use-tally/delegate-on-tally/).

### Delegation&#x20;

Enable token holders to delegate voting power to trusted representatives without transferring token ownership. Tally's delegation system supports full delegation, [partial delegation](../../how-to-use-tally/delegate-on-tally/partial-delegation.md) across multiple delegates, and integrations with [staking](../incentives-and-staking/) and [token launch.](../token-launch/)

### **Multichain support**

Enable cross-chain governance with [Multigov](multigov.md) to meet token holders where they are. Organization members can govern from any chain, with support for Solana, Ethereum, and EVM-compatible L2s. MultiGov lowers barriers to participation by reducing gas costs for L1 governance and allows protocols to expand to new networks while maintaining unified governance.&#x20;

### **Gasless voting and delegation (Relay)**

Remove financial barriers to governance participation by eliminating gas fees for voting and delegation. Relay is a sponsorship system where organizations cover transaction costs for members' governance activities.&#x20;

### **Chain integration**

Expand governance across new EVM networks with full platform support. Tally integrates network archive nodes, block explorers, and API access to enable all platform features. Integration process typically takes 5-10 business days.
