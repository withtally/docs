#### &#x20;<a href="#h-key-features-of-tallys-token-launch-system" id="h-key-features-of-tallys-token-launch-system"></a>

* [Airdrops](airdrops.md): Distribute tokens to millions of recipients with gas-optimized claim processing
* [Branded claim experiences](features.md#branded-claim-experience): Ship custom-designed claim pages with your branding and domain that provide clarity and consistency across all token operations
* [Vesting & distribution integration](vesting-and-disitribution.md): Implement lockup periods and vesting schedules that integrate seamlessly with on-chain providers and custodians
* [Multichain support](features.md#multichain-support): Launch tokens simultaneously across multiple EVM chains with unified supply management. Recipients claim on their preferred network without wrapped assets or bridging
* [Modular architecture](features.md#modular-architecture): Launch just the token, pair it with [staking](../incentives-and-staking/) from day one to incentivize long-term commitment, add [governance](../governance/) to enable decentralized decision-making immediately, or progressively enable components later as your protocol matures.&#x20;
