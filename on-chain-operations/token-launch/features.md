# Features

### Modular architecture

Launch just the token, pair it with [staking](../incentives-and-staking/) from day one to incentivize long-term commitment, add [governance](../governance/) to enable decentralized decision-making immediately, or progressively enable components later as your protocol matures.&#x20;

### Branded claim experience

Tally builds branded claim interfaces in close collaboration with your team to ensure brand alignment and user clarity. Custom domains maintain consistent branding across all token operations.

### Launch with governance&#x20;

Tally deploys your protocol's governance smart contracts, including Governor and Timelock, ensure a smooth and convenient transition from token claim to active governance participation.

* **Launch with ERC20Votes**
  * Tally deploys your token, a non-fungible, non-transferable token that can be minted and revoked by the Governor. The ERC20Votes extension ensures your governance token supports vote delegation and efficient tracking of voting power over time.
* **Deploy  Governor and Timelock contracts**
  * Tally deploys the [Governor and Timelock contracts](../../set-up-and-technical-documentation/deploying-daos/). The Governor contract facilitates the proposal and voting process, while the Timelock contract enforces a delay between the proposal's passage and its execution.
    * [Flexible Voting](../../how-to-use-tally/voting-on-proposals/advanced-voting/flexible-voting-extension.md)**:** Tally's flexible voting setup prepares protocols for advanced governance structures. Flexible voting enables sophisticated governance models like MultiGov and partial delegation.
* **Claim & delegate**&#x20;
  * To ensure a smooth and convenient transition from token claim to active governance participation, Tally provides a post-claim delegation experience to enhance user engagement and simplify the delegation process.
* **Launch with expert guidance**
  * Tally provides detailed guidance on setting key parameters to ensure smooth and effective operation of the protocol's governance system: Proposal Threshold, Quorum Requirement, Voting Period, Voting Delay, Execution Delay, and more.

### Multichain support

Launch tokens simultaneously across multiple EVM chains. Recipients claim on their preferred network without wrapped assets or bridging, eliminating friction and complexity from multichain distributions. Tally's cross chain claiming experience reduces operational overhead, improves user experience, and ensures token holders can participate from any supported chain without technical barriers.

### Post-launch operations

Tally provides continued technical support, infrastructure monitoring, and feature development as your protocol grows.

Tally helps your team prepare for a clean launch:

* Pre-launch links and interfaces
* Educational and onboarding materials
* Page scaffolding
* Integration with specialized tooling and providers as needed
