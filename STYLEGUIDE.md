# Tally Documentation Style Guide

This style guide outlines the writing standards for Tally's documentation. It's designed to help both human writers and AI assistants create and update documentation that is consistent with Tally's existing style.

## Voice and Tone

- **Clear and direct**: Write in a straightforward manner that gets to the point quickly.
- **Professional but conversational**: Maintain a balance between technical professionalism and approachable language.
- **Helpful and supportive**: The documentation should feel like a helpful guide, not just a technical manual.
- **Confident**: Present information with authority. Avoid hedging language like "might," "could," or "should" when describing how features work.

## Content Structure

### Document Organization

- **Start with a concise overview**: Begin documents with a brief explanation of what the feature or concept is.
- **Use clear hierarchical headings**: Organize content with H1, H2, H3 headings in a logical hierarchy.
- **Include navigation links**: Where appropriate, include links to related documentation.
- **End with resources**: When applicable, include a "Resources" section with external links.

### Section Structure

- **Descriptive titles**: Use clear, descriptive headings that tell users what information they'll find.
- **Front-load important information**: Put the most critical information first.
- **Use step-by-step instructions**: For processes, use numbered steps.
- **Keep paragraphs short**: Aim for 2-3 sentences per paragraph for easy scanning.

## Formatting

### Text Formatting

- **Use bold for emphasis**: Use **bold** for UI elements, buttons, and important concepts.
- **Use italics sparingly**: Use *italics* only when necessary for emphasis.
- **Use code formatting for code**: Use `code` formatting for code snippets, file names, and API endpoints.

### Lists

- **Use bullet points for related items**: Use bullets for lists of related but unordered items.
- **Use numbered lists for sequential steps**: Use numbers for processes that must be followed in order.
- **Be consistent with punctuation**: Either use periods at the end of all list items or none.

### Code Examples

- **Include code blocks for technical content**: Use triple backticks for multiline code.
- **Specify the language**: When using code blocks, specify the language.
- **Add comments to explain complex code**: Include comments to explain what the code does.

## Language Guidelines

### General Writing Style

- **Use active voice**: Write "Click the button" instead of "The button should be clicked."
- **Be concise**: Remove unnecessary words and phrases.
- **Use present tense**: Write "The system displays" instead of "The system will display."
- **Address the reader directly**: Use "you" instead of "the user" or "one."
- **Write simple sentences**: Keep sentences short and focused on one idea. Aim for 15-20 words per sentence.
- **Break up complex ideas**: Split complex concepts into multiple short sentences rather than one long one.
- **Use simple words**: Choose common, everyday words over complex or technical terminology when possible.
- **Avoid multiple clauses**: Keep sentence structure straightforward with minimal dependent clauses.

### Technical Terminology

- **Define jargon on first use**: When introducing a technical term, provide a brief definition.
- **Be consistent with terminology**: Use the same term to refer to the same concept throughout.
- **Use commonly accepted terms**: When possible, use industry-standard terminology.

### Phrases to Use

- "To do X, follow these steps..."
- "Learn more about..."
- "For detailed information, see..."
- "Note that..." (for important caveats or considerations)

### Phrases to Avoid

- "Simply" or "just" (as in "simply click the button")
- "Easy" or "easily" (not all users find the same things easy)
- "Obviously" or "clearly" (what's obvious to some isn't to others)
- "As mentioned above/below" (use direct links instead)
- Long, complex sentences with multiple clauses
- Unnecessarily formal or academic language

## Visual Elements

### Screenshots and Images

- **Include screenshots for complex UI interactions**: Use screenshots to clarify complex steps.
- **Use captions**: Add descriptive captions to screenshots.
- **Highlight relevant areas**: Use arrows or circles to highlight important areas in screenshots.
- **Keep images up-to-date**: Update screenshots when the UI changes.

### Diagrams

- **Use diagrams for complex concepts**: Create visual representations of complex processes or architectures.
- **Keep diagrams simple**: Focus on the most important elements.
- **Include a legend**: Explain what different shapes or colors represent.

## Special Elements

### Notes and Warnings

- **Use hint style blocks for important information**: Utilize hint blocks for notes, warnings, and tips.
- **Be specific about consequences**: For warnings, clearly explain what might happen if the warning is ignored.

### Examples

- **Include practical examples**: Provide real-world examples to illustrate concepts.
- **Make examples relatable**: Use scenarios that users are likely to encounter.

## Links and References

- **Use descriptive link text**: Avoid "click here" or "read more"; instead, describe what the link leads to.
- **Link to official resources**: When referencing external content, link to official documentation or trusted sources.
- **Check links regularly**: Ensure links remain valid and update broken links.

## Inclusive Language

- **Use gender-neutral language**: Avoid using gendered pronouns when not referring to a specific person.
- **Be mindful of cultural references**: Ensure examples and analogies are universally understandable.
- **Avoid ableist language**: Don't use terms that could be considered insensitive to people with disabilities.

## File Naming and Organization

- **Use kebab-case for file names**: Use lowercase with hyphens for file names (e.g., `getting-started.md`).
- **Group related files in directories**: Organize files in a logical directory structure.
- **Use descriptive file names**: Choose names that reflect the content of the file.

## Review Process

- **Check for accuracy**: Ensure all technical information is correct.
- **Verify against the product**: Test instructions against the current version of the product.
- **Proofread for clarity**: Review for clear, concise language.
- **Check formatting**: Ensure consistent formatting throughout.
- **Evaluate sentence complexity**: Check if sentences can be simplified further.

By following these guidelines, you'll create documentation that is consistent with Tally's existing style and provides users with a helpful, informative experience.
