# Post-Launch Tooling Overview

Your token sale is just the beginning. Tally provides a complete platform for your token's lifecycle, from governance and voting to staking and security councils. No need to switch providers - keep building with the same platform.

## Why Post-Launch Matters

A successful token sale creates stakeholders. What you do next determines whether those stakeholders become an engaged community or passive holders.

### Common Post-Launch Challenges

- **Governance void:** No mechanism for community decision-making
- **Passive holders:** Token holders with no way to participate
- **Value leakage:** Protocol revenue not flowing to stakeholders
- **Security concerns:** Centralized control over critical operations

### The Tally Solution

Tally addresses each challenge:

- **Governance:** Voting, proposals, and delegation
- **Engagement:** Staking, incentives, and participation rewards
- **Value accrual:** Protocol revenue distribution to stakers
- **Security:** Council elections and distributed oversight

## Available Tooling

### Governance

Empower your community with decentralized decision-making:

- **Proposal creation:** Community members propose changes
- **Voting:** Token holders vote on proposals
- **Execution:** Approved proposals execute automatically
- **Treasury management:** Secure fund allocation through governance

### Voting and Delegation

Enable flexible participation:

- **Direct voting:** Token holders vote themselves
- **Delegation:** Delegate voting power to representatives
- **Partial delegation:** Split voting power across delegates
- **Gasless participation:** Remove gas barriers to voting

### Staking and Incentives

Reward aligned behavior:

- **Staking for value accrual:** Distribute protocol revenue to stakers
- **Governance rewards:** Incentivize governance participation
- **Liquidity incentives:** Reward LP providers
- **Custom programs:** Design rewards for your specific needs

### Security Councils

Establish community oversight:

- **Council elections:** Democratic selection of council members
- **Emergency powers:** Rapid response to security issues
- **Distributed control:** Decentralize critical operations
- **Term limits:** Regular rotation and accountability
