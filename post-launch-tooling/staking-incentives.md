# Staking and Incentives

Well-designed incentives and staking programs attract aligned token holders who add value to your protocol. Tally provides a complete, modular staking solution - open-source smart contracts and a ready-to-use interface that makes participation effortless.

## Why Staking Matters

After a token sale, staking:

- **Returns value:** Distribute protocol revenue to token holders
- **Encourages commitment:** Reward long-term holding
- **Drives participation:** Incentivize governance engagement
- **Provides utility:** Give tokens functional value

## Staking for Value Accrual

Distribute protocol value to committed stakeholders:

### How It Works

1. **Stake tokens:** Holders lock tokens in staking contract
2. **Earn rewards:** Protocol distributes rewards to stakers
3. **Claim or compound:** Withdraw rewards or add to stake
4. **Unstake:** Remove tokens (subject to any cooldown)

### Reward Sources

Staking rewards can come from:

- **Protocol revenue:** Fees generated by the protocol
- **Treasury allocation:** Distributions from treasury
- **Token emissions:** New token issuance
- **External rewards:** Partner incentives

### Distribution Mechanics

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Pro-rata | Proportional to stake | Fair distribution |
| Time-weighted | Longer staking = more rewards | Encourage commitment |
| Activity-based | Rewards for specific actions | Behavioral incentives |

## Governance Integration

Staking integrates with governance:

### Voting Power Preservation

Staked tokens retain governance rights:

- Vote while staking
- Delegate staked voting power
- No governance penalty for staking

### Participation Rewards

Reward governance participation:

- Additional rewards for active voters
- Delegate compensation for representatives
- Governance engagement multipliers

## Delegate Compensation

Reward engaged governance participants:

### How It Works

1. **Define criteria:** Set participation requirements
2. **Track activity:** Monitor delegate behavior
3. **Calculate rewards:** Based on participation metrics
4. **Distribute:** Automatic or claimable rewards

### Eligibility Criteria

| Criterion | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Minimum stake | Tokens staked | 1,000 tokens |
| Participation rate | Voting frequency | 80%+ of proposals |
| Reputation score | Quality metrics | DRS > 75 |

## Liquid Staking

Stake while maintaining liquidity:

### LST (Liquid Staking Tokens)

Receive transferable token representing stake:

- Trade or use in DeFi
- Maintain staking rewards
- No lockup requirement
- Composable with other protocols

### stGOV LST

Tally's liquid staking implementation:

- Automatic delegation
- DeFi composability
- Governance integration
- Audited contracts

## Configuration Options

### Staking Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Minimum Stake | Smallest allowed stake | 1-100 tokens |
| Cooldown Period | Time to unstake | 0-30 days |
| Reward Rate | Distribution rate | Variable |
| Compound Option | Auto-compound rewards | On/Off |

### Reward Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Options |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Reward Token | Token distributed | Native/Other ERC20 |
| Distribution Frequency | How often rewards distribute | Block/Daily/Weekly |
| Vesting | Reward lockup | Immediate/Vested |

## Integration with Token Sales

### Post-Sale Staking

Enable staking immediately after sale:

- Participants can stake purchased tokens
- Even locked tokens can earn rewards (where configured)
- Build staking culture from day one

### Incentivizing Lockups

Reward longer commitments:

- Higher rewards for longer stakes
- Bonus multipliers for early stakers
- Graduated reward tiers

## Use Cases

### Protocol Revenue Distribution

Share success with stakeholders:

```
Protocol Revenue → Treasury → Staking Contract → Stakers
```

### Governance Incentivization

Reward active governance:

```
Treasury Allocation → Participation Metrics → Active Voters
```

### Liquidity Mining

Incentivize LP provision:

```
Token Emissions → LP Staking Contract → Liquidity Providers
```

### Network Security

Reward validators or operators:

```
Protocol Fees → Operator Rewards → Network Validators
```

## Best Practices

### Program Design

Design sustainable programs:

- **Sustainable rewards:** Don't over-promise emissions
- **Clear mechanics:** Easy to understand
- **Fair distribution:** Avoid whale concentration
- **Aligned incentives:** Reward beneficial behavior

### Communication

Set clear expectations:

- Document staking mechanics
- Publish reward schedules
- Explain risks clearly
- Provide regular updates

### Monitoring

Track program health:

- Participation rates
- Distribution metrics
- Stakeholder composition
- Reward sustainability

## Technical Implementation
