# Upgrade Gnosis Safe to Governor with Zodiac

[Dennison](https://twitter.com/dennisonbertram) from Tally and [Auryn Macmillan](https://twitter.com/auryn\_macmillan) from Zodiac put together this video walkthrough about how to upgrade a Gnosis Safe to an on-chain Governor on Tally:

This upgrade path is particularly useful for progressively decentralizing a DAO. Often, a multi-sig makes sense for a newer DAO with a smaller treasury. As the stakeholder set expands, organization might find that it needs the security and decentralization of on-chain proposals.

This Zodiac upgrade path makes it easy to progressively convert the Safe into a Governor without moving all assets and permissions between contracts.
