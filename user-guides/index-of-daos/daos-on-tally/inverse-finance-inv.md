## **Protocol Overview**

Inverse Finance is a decentralized protocol offering a suite of defi services including automated investing strategies, a lending market, and a US dollar pegged stablecoin. The protocol was entirely fair launched, with initial tokens given out to Discord members for free on the condition that they participate actively in governance.

Governance controls all aspects of the protocol, including control over the communityâ€™s allocation of unspent INV tokens and other treasury assets, as well as asset and risk parameters for the lending and stablecoin services.
