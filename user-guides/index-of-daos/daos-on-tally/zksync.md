## Protocol Overview

\
ZKsync is an ever expanding verifiable blockchain network, secured by math. ZK chains are high performance, verifiable, modular rollups and validiums powered by ZKsync. United in an elastic network, ZK chains can be added or expanded to handle increased transaction volume without affecting costs or hardware requirements for verification. ZK chains provide native, frictionless interoperability presented in a consistent and easy-to-use interface. This enables trustless communication and asset transfers between chains leveraging the full range of users and liquidity across the entire ZK chain ecosystem. Unlike traditional, centralized solutions, this protocol relies solely on cryptography for security.
