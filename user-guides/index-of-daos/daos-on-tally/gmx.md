## Protocol Overview

GMX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol designed for spot and perpetual trading of cryptocurrencies, offering users the ability to trade with leverage directly on-chain. Built on Arbitrum and Avalanche, GMX emphasizes efficiency and low-cost transactions. It features a unique multi-asset liquidity pool (GLP) that provides liquidity for trades while allowing liquidity providers to earn fees from trading, leverage, and market-making activities. GMX uses a pricing mechanism derived from Chainlink oracles and time-weighted average prices to minimize liquidations and protect traders from price manipulation. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and secure, catering to both retail and institutional users seeking trustless and transparent trading options.
