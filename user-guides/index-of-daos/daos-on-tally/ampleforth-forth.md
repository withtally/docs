* Industry: Synthetic Assets

## **Protocol Overview**

The Ampleforth protocol offers an elastic supply token (AMPL) that is intended to serve as an alternative reserve asset and stable unit of account. It targets a price of $1 through non-dillutive rebases that increase or reduce all owners holdings to match total token supply with demand. This means that while the price of AMPL should stay fairly stable, the value of AMPL holdings can fluctuate widely based on market conditions.

The protocol is managed and maintained by FORTH governance token holders. Responsibilities include control of the community treasury and distribution of additional FORTH tokens earned through inflation, along with maintenance of the key oracle and keeper infrastructure underpinning the AMPL token rebase mechanism.
