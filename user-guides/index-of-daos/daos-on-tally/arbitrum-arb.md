## Protocol Overview

\
Arbitrum is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve the speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of transactions while maintaining Ethereumâ€™s security and decentralization. Built using Optimistic Rollup technology, Arbitrum processes transactions off-chain and batches them before submitting the results to the Ethereum mainnet, significantly reducing gas fees and network congestion. It supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, making it easy for developers to migrate or build decentralized applications (dApps) on the platform. By enabling faster and cheaper transactions, Arbitrum is designed to enhance the user experience and broaden Ethereum's usability for decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and other blockchain applications.
