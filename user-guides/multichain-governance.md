# ⛓️ Multichain Governance

Tally has partnered with [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) to power Multichain governance for DAOs. &#x20;

**What is Multichain Governance?**

At its core multichain governance allows token holders across different blockchain networks to actively participate in the governance process regardless of a token’s origin chain. A token can originate from Solana, Ethereum, or an EVM-compatible L2 and users can create, vote, & execute governance proposals on any other compatible chain. The multichain governance approach breaks down the barriers between different blockchain ecosystems by fostering a more unified & participatory governance environment.

**Single-chain vs Multichain**&#x20;

DAOs traditionally operate using single chain governance. Ex: Compound Finance launches governance token & Governor on Ethereum mainnet & all requisite governance activities take place exclusively on Ethereum and succumb to prohibitively high gas fees.

Multichain governance offers DAOs the flexibility to use other chains through a hub and spoke model (fig 2). Essentially providing a significantly cheaper & sometimes faster environment for governance participation.&#x20;

Benefits of Multichain:&#x20;

* Save on gas costs
* Govern protocol across multiple chains&#x20;
* Meet community where they are&#x20;
* Decoupling the protocol & governance&#x20;
