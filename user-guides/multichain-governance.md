# ⛓️ Multichain Governance

Tally has partnered with [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) to power Multichain governance for DAOs. &#x20;

**What is Multichain Governance?**

At its core multichain governance allows token holders across different blockchain networks to actively participate in the governance process regardless of a token’s origin chain. A token can originate from Solana, Ethereum, or an EVM-compatible L2 and users can create, vote, & execute governance proposals on any other compatible chain. The multichain governance approach breaks down the barriers between different blockchain ecosystems by fostering a more unified & participatory governance environment.

**Single-chain vs Multichain**&#x20;

DAOs traditionally operate using single chain governance. Ex: Compound Finance launches governance token & Governor on Ethereum mainnet & all requisite governance activities take place exclusively on Ethereum and succumb to prohibitively high gas fees.

Multichain governance offers DAOs the flexibility to use other chains through a hub and spoke model (fig 2). Essentially providing a significantly cheaper & sometimes faster environment for governance participation.&#x20;

Benefits of Multichain:&#x20;

* Save on gas costs
* Govern protocol across multiple chains&#x20;
* Meet community where they are&#x20;
* Decoupling the protocol & governance&#x20;

**The Wormhole DAO**

The Wormhole DAO, powered by $W token holders, is set to operate under this pioneering multichain governance system. By enabling token holders on any supported chain to engage in the governance process, Wormhole is ensuring that its community can steer the protocol in a direction that reflects the diverse interests & needs of its members. This approach to governance will significantly enhance the user experience (UX) making community contributions  easier & more accessible.Wormhole contributors hope this will mark the beginning of a fully decentralized & community-led decision-making process across all Wormhole supported chains.
