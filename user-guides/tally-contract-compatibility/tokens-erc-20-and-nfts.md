  How to make an ERC-20 or ERC-721 token contract that will work with onchain
  governance.

# Tokens: ERC20 and NFTs

Tally expects tokens to implement the relevant standard, like [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) or  [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721). Also, Tally needs the token contract to implement the [EIP-5805 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5805) for delegation and voting power checkpointing.&#x20;

Specifically, Tally needs the following methods and event signatures for indexing and web3 calls:

### Event signatures



Tally's API listens to event logs from token contracts when indexing them. Your token contract will need to maintain the same event signatures:

```
event DelegateVotesChanged(
    address indexed delegate, 
    uint previousBalance, 
    uint newBalance
);
event DelegateChanged(
    address indexed delegator, 
    address indexed fromDelegate, 
    address indexed toDelegate
);
```

Your contract will need to support transfer events, too.  Tally works with both ERC20 transfer events and ERC721 events.

#### ERC20:

```
event Transfer(
    address indexed from, 
    address indexed to, 
    uint256 amount
);


```

#### ERC721:

```
  event Transfer(
    address indexed from, 
    address indexed to, 
    uint256 indexed tokenId
);
```



### Function signatures

Your token contract also needs to implement voting and delegation functions. If you are using an ERC20 token, you can use the [`ERC20Votes`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol) or the [`ERC20VotesComp`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20VotesComp.sol) extensions from the OpenZeppelin token contracts library.

If you're using an ERC71 token, you can use OpenZeppelin's draft [`ERC721Votes`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions) extension.

The Tally frontend helps users make these function calls to delegate their votes:

```
function delegate(address delegatee)
function delegateBySig(
    address delegatee, 
    uint nonce, 
    uint expiry, 
    uint8 v, 
    bytes32 r, 
    bytes32 s
)
function getVotes(address account) uint256
function name() string
function symbol() string

// ERC20 only:
function decimals() public view returns (uint8) 
```

#### Name

The token contract must implement the `name()` function, so that Tally knows what to call the token.

```
function name() string
```

#### Symbol

The token contract must implement a `symbol()` function, so that Tally knows the short name of the token.

```
function symbol() string
```

#### Decimals

ERC20 token contracts must implement a `decimals()` function, so that Tally can correctly render token balances:

```
function decimals() public view returns (uint8) 
```
