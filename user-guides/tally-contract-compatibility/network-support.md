# Network Support

Tally currently supports these EVM-compatible networks:

**Ethereum**

* Ethereum Mainnet and Goerli Testnet

**Polygon**

* Polygon Mainnet and Mumbai Testnet

**Binance Smart Chain**&#x20;

* BSC Mainnet

**Arbitrum**

* Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Goerli

**Optimism**

* Optimism and Optimism Goerli Testnet

**Avalanche**

* Avalanche C-Chain and Fuji Test

**Gnosis Chain**

* Gnosis Chain mainnet

### Adding chains to Tally

To support a chain, Tally has several must-have dependencies:

* Network is EVM-compatible
* A full node for user web3 calls
* An archive node with a high rate limit for indexing
* A block explorer with an Etherscan-compatible API

In addition, these nice-to-have dependencies will unlock all the features and improve the UX:

* Support from major wallets for the network
* [Gnosis Safe Available Services](https://docs.safe.global/safe-core-api/available-services#safe-transaction-service)
* [Tenderly network support](https://docs.tenderly.co/supported-networks-and-languages)
