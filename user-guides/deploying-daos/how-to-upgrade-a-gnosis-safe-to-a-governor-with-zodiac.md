# Upgrade Gnosis Safe to Governor with Zodiac

[Dennison Bertram](https://twitter.com/dennisonbertram) from Tally and [Auryn Macmillan](https://twitter.com/auryn\_macmillan) from Zodiac put together this video walkthrough about how to upgrade a Gnosis Safe to an onchain Governor on Tally:

This upgrade path is particularly useful for progressively decentralizing a DAO. Often, a multi-sig makes sense for a newer DAO with a smaller treasury. As the stakeholder set expands, organization might find that it needs the security and decentralization of onchain proposals.

This Zodiac upgrade path makes it easy to progressively convert the Safe into a Governor without moving all assets and permissions between contracts.
